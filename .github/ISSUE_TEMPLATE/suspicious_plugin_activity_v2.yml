        You might come across a plugin that appears to be doing something suspicious that it shouldn't,
        like installing things on your system it doesn't need for its task, tracking without the
        possibility to opt-in, suspicious network connections to weird locations and so on.


        In such a case please first seek clarification of the issue with the plugin author by
        getting in touch with them e.g. on their plugin's issue tracker. If this isn't fruitful or
        you do not get any reply, fill out the form below and we'll investigate.

        features are **not** what qualifies as suspicious activity.

        The plugin author should be contacted first and asked to clarify the situation.
        Only proceed if this attempt at resolving the problem isn't fruitful or the author
        doesn't react.

        If there's no public issue tracker, some other form of proof should be provided
        here that the an attempt at a friendly resolution was actually made.
