<!--
You might come across a plugin that appears to be doing something suspicious that it shouldn't,
like installing things on your system it doesn't need for its task, tracking without the
possibility to opt-in, suspicious network connections to weird locations and so on.

In such a case please first seek clarification of the issue with the plugin author by
getting in touch with them e.g. on their plugin's issue tracker. If this isn't fruitful or
you do not get any reply, fill out the template below and we'll investigate.
