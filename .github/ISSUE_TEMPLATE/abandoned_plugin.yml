        It might happen that a plugin becomes abandoned by its maintainer.


        If it looks like this is the case, please first try to get in touch with the maintainer,
        e.g. by opening a (friendly!) ticket on the plugin's repository asking if it is still
        being actively maintained by the author and if not if they would be open to putting it up
        for adoption.


        If you do not get a response on this within a reasonable time (use the general response times
        on the tracker to judge this) then report the plugin as abandoned here. Be sure to include
        the ticket on the plugin's tracker you opened to confirm abandonment.


        If you or someone else is open to taking over plugin maintenance, please also
        mention them.

        We either need a link to a ticket on the plugin's issue tracker or to some other
        form of proof that the plugin in fact has been abandoned. If no such thing exists
        yet then please create a ticket asking the maintainer if the plugin is still being
        maintained, and only if you don't hear anything back within a reasonable time come
        back here and report the plugin as abandoned.
