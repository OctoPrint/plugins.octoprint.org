# Update check overlays for Python 2 instances specifically. Format:
#
#   pluginID:
#     user: new github user
#     repo: new github repo
#     pip: new pip URL
#     ...
#
# Any keys from the software update config can be overwritten, changing the default values. config.yaml on the
# instances out there still wins though, in case the user has a personal override configured.
