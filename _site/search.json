If you have your OctoPrint installation’s bundled discovery plugin also configured with pybonjour support you’ll also be able to see all the Growl instances on your local network that OctoPrint was able to discover there.By default only the notifications for “Printjob started” and “Printjob done” are enabled. If you also want to get notification about the other events, you’ll have to tell Growl. OctoPrint will send them all, but your local Growlinstance needs to be told to also display them. You can do this in the configuration of your Growl service. For example,this is how it looks in Growl for Windows:",

It is a post processingutility that converts gcode into x3g files for printing on MakerBots or theirclones.This plugin wraps the serial communication layer and uses GPX to translate betweengcode and x3g on the fly to make the printer appear to OctoPrint as if it speaksgcode.###ConfigurationAfter installing, you need to tell gpx about your printer. In OctoPrint, GPXadds a settings panel. Two settings are important to set: the type ofprinter and the gcode flavor.The type of printer determines the steps per mm. Gcode is generally inmillimeters and x3g is in stepper motor steps.Gcode flavor means the flavor that your slicer produces. Makerbot Desktop andRepG only produce MakerBot flavor. Slic3r produces either (you can choose inits settings) and Cura produces RepRap flavor.If you have a MakerBot clone then you have a Replicator 1 or Replicator 1 Dualclone. Your printer might look more like a Replicator 2 because it is black andmetal, but its steps per mm is Replicator 1.###Caveats and Known IssuesPlease see the READMEon github for the latest info.",

You may want to avoid this stitching and just havejavascript display the jpg images every few hundred milliseconds instead.A couple of reasons might be:      You want to use a browser that doesn’t support mjpeg streams (IE).        You want to reduce your bandwidth and cpu usage on your host.  You can reduce bandwidth and cpu usage by reducing the frame rate onmjpg-streamer, but perhaps the plugin is even lighter weight, try it out onyour hardware and see.SettingsThe plugin has a couple of settings you can change:      Frames per second.    The plugin uses javascript to update the snapshot so the frames are really limited by the browsers ability/willingness to call a timer interval function. Probably best to stay in the slow, reliable, but choppy end of things: 1, 2 or 4 or something like that.        Fallback mode only.    The plugin only takes over and uses snapshots when the stream fails to load.  ",

"description": "Adds support for slicing via Slic3r from within OctoPrint",
"author": "Javier Martínez Arrieta, Eyal Soha",
"content": "Slic3r plugin for OctoPrintWARNINGThis plugin has been successfully tested for the following cases:  Linux: Slic3r’s stable versions 1.1.7 and 1.2.9 (tests done under a Raspberry Pi 2, but it should work for other Linux distributions).  Windows: Slic3r works for version 1.2.9, not doing it for version 1.1.7.SetupIn order to install the plugin, go to Settings -&gt; Plugin Manager and click on ‘Get more…’:You’ll see an option to add it from an URL. Add https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-Slic3r/archive/master.zip an click on ‘Install’ button.At this moment, the plugin will be installed, but Slic3r must be downloaded and configured, which can be done following these steps:      If OctoPrint is running under a Raspberry Pi, you can use the following script to install Slic3r (unfortunately precompiled packages do not work for RPI’s architecture). For that purpose, copy the following code in a file (i.e. slic3r_install.sh).         #!/bin/sh   echo \"Shell script created by Javier Martínez Arrieta for Slic3r installation\\n\" #Ask the user for a version echo \"Please indicate which version you desire to be installed (e.g. 1.1.7)\" read version echo \"The installation of Slic3r takes a long time. PLease be patient\" cd $HOME echo \"Installing required libraries and dependencies...\" sudo apt-get install git libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev git-core build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev libwx-perl libmodule-build-perl libnet-dbus-perl cpanminus libextutils-cbuilder-perl gcc-4.7 g++-4.7 libwx-perl libperl-dev sudo cpanm AAR/Boost-Geometry-Utils-0.06.tar.gz Math::Clipper Math::ConvexHull Math::ConvexHull::MonotoneChain Math::Geometry::Voronoi Math::PlanePath Moo IO::Scalar Class::XSAccessor Growl::GNTP XML::SAX::ExpatXS PAR::Packer echo \"Cloning Slic3r repository...\" git clone https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r.git cd Slic3r git checkout $version echo \"Building and testing Scli3r...\" sudo perl Build.PL echo \"If everything was installed properly,you should be able to run Slic3r with the command ./slic3r.pl\"            Save the file and allow execution giving permission. Using a terminal, it would be chmod +x slic3r_install.sh (or the name given to the file).     chmod +x slic3r_install.sh        Now that you have permission to execute it, type ./slic3r_install.sh and press ‘Enter’. If it is the first time executing the installer, take into account that it can take about 30 minutes or even more.     ./slic3r_install.sh        At the beggining of the installation, you will be asked which version should be installed (available versions at http://slic3r.org/download)            If you get an out of memory error it’s because Raspberry Pi doesn’t have enough swap memory to build Slic3r by default. You will need to increase the swap size. To do this, run sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile and set CONF_SWAPSIZE=1000 then save and reboot. After reboot, run free -h and confirm that total swap size is around 1000MB.        Execute OctoPrint and go to Settings (or restart when you are asked after installing the plugin). Slic3r should appear in Plugins list:            In ‘General’, you should put the following path for the executable (supposing the execution of the script, the path would be /home/pi/Slic3r/slic3r.pl). Note: If running in Windows, write the path to slic3r-console:            Before importing the profile, you have to export a file with the Slic3r’s configuration. For that purpose, open Slic3r, and select File-&gt; Export Config…            Save the file with the desired name (e.g. config.ini):            Once done, in ‘Profiles’ click ‘Import Profile…’ button:            Click on ‘Browse…’ and search for the profile. Once done, save with the name and identifier wished by clicking ‘Confirm’:            Click ‘Save’ to confirm Slic3r settings:            Now you can slice your stl files:      ",

"description": "Adds handling for user-definable action commands.",
"author": "Ben Lye",
"content": "Adds handling for custom action commands to OctoPrint. Action commands are sent from the RepRap machine in the form //action:command.The plugin allows OctoPrint to execute a system command or send G-code to the printer in response to an action command.UsageAs of the latest Marlin bugfix-1.1.x version, the command M118 can be used to echo output to serial, meaning that M118 //action:dostuff would cause this plugin to try to handle the dostuff command when //action:dostuff was echoed back on the serial console.A future application of the plugin would be to add actions in the RepRap machine’s firmware so that hosts could respond.  For example, when Marlin is killed because something is wrong it would echo //action:poweroff and the attached OctoPrint instance could use this action command to trigger the printer’s power outlet to switch off.Action Command References  OctoPrint Documentation  RepRap Wiki",
