If you have your OctoPrint installation’sbundled discovery plugin alsoconfigured with pybonjour supportyou’ll also be able to see all the Growl instances on your local network that OctoPrint was able to discover there.By default only the notifications for “Printjob started” and “Printjob done” are enabled. If you also want to getnotification about the other events, you’ll have to tell Growl. OctoPrint will send them all, but your local Growlinstance needs to be told to also display them. You can do this in the configuration of your Growl service. Thisis how it might look:",

It is a post processingutility that converts gcode into x3g files for printing on MakerBots or theirclones.This plugin wraps the serial communication layer and uses GPX to translate betweengcode and x3g on the fly to make the printer appear to OctoPrint as if it speaksgcode.ConfigurationAfter installing, you need to tell gpx about your printer. In OctoPrint, GPXadds a settings panel. Two settings are important to set: the type ofprinter and the gcode flavor.The type of printer determines the steps per mm. Gcode is generally inmillimeters and x3g is in stepper motor steps.Gcode flavor means the flavor that your slicer produces. Makerbot Desktop andRepG only produce MakerBot flavor. Slic3r produces either (you can choose inits settings) and Cura produces RepRap flavor.If you have a MakerBot clone then you have a Replicator 1 or Replicator 1 Dualclone. Your printer might look more like a Replicator 2 because it is black andmetal, but its steps per mm is Replicator 1.Caveats and Known IssuesPlease see the READMEon github for the latest info.",

You may want to avoid this stitching and just havejavascript display the jpg images every few hundred milliseconds instead.A couple of reasons might be:      You want to use a browser that doesn’t support mjpeg streams (IE).        You want to reduce your bandwidth and cpu usage on your host.  You can reduce bandwidth and cpu usage by reducing the frame rate onmjpg-streamer, but perhaps the plugin is even lighter weight, try it out onyour hardware and see.SettingsThe plugin has a couple of settings you can change:      Frames per second.    The plugin uses javascript to update the snapshot so the frames are really limited by the browsers ability/willingness to call a timer interval function. Probably best to stay in the slow, reliable, but choppy end of things: 1, 2 or 4 or something like that.        Fallback mode only.    The plugin only takes over and uses snapshots when the stream fails to load.  ",

It is not actively maintained since it does what is needed from it for regular OctoPrint development activities.

"author": "Javier Martínez Arrieta, Eyal Soha",
"content": "Slic3r plugin for OctoPrintWARNINGThis plugin has been successfully tested for the following cases:  Linux: Slic3r’s stable versions 1.1.7 and 1.2.9 (tests done under a Raspberry Pi 2, but it should work for other Linux distributions).  Windows: Slic3r works for version 1.2.9, not doing it for version 1.1.7.SetupIn order to install the plugin, go to Settings -&gt; Plugin Manager and click on ‘Get more…’:You’ll see an option to add it from an URL. Add https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-Slic3r/archive/master.zip an click on ‘Install’ button.At this moment, the plugin will be installed, but Slic3r must be downloaded and configured, which can be done following these steps:      If OctoPrint is running under a Raspberry Pi, you can use the following script to install Slic3r (unfortunately precompiled packages do not work for RPI’s architecture). For that purpose, copy the following code in a file (i.e. slic3r_install.sh).         #!/bin/sh echo \"Shell script created by Javier Martínez Arrieta for Slic3r installation\\n\" #Ask the user for a version echo \"Please indicate which version you desire to be installed (e.g. 1.1.7)\" read version echo \"The installation of Slic3r takes a long time. PLease be patient\" cd $HOME echo \"Installing required libraries and dependencies...\" sudo apt-get install git libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev git-core build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev libwx-perl libmodule-build-perl libnet-dbus-perl cpanminus libextutils-cbuilder-perl gcc-4.7 g++-4.7 libwx-perl libperl-dev sudo cpanm AAR/Boost-Geometry-Utils-0.06.tar.gz Math::Clipper Math::ConvexHull Math::ConvexHull::MonotoneChain Math::Geometry::Voronoi Math::PlanePath Moo IO::Scalar Class::XSAccessor Growl::GNTP XML::SAX::ExpatXS PAR::Packer echo \"Cloning Slic3r repository...\" git clone https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r.git cd Slic3r git checkout $version echo \"Building and testing Scli3r...\" sudo perl Build.PL echo \"If everything was installed properly,you should be able to run Slic3r with the command ./slic3r.pl\"            Save the file and allow execution giving permission. Using a terminal, it would be chmod +x slic3r_install.sh (or the name given to the file).     chmod +x slic3r_install.sh        Now that you have permission to execute it, type ./slic3r_install.sh and press ‘Enter’. If it is the first time executing the installer, take into account that it can take about 30 minutes or even more.     ./slic3r_install.sh        At the beggining of the installation, you will be asked which version should be installed (available versions at http://slic3r.org/download)            If you get an out of memory error it’s because Raspberry Pi doesn’t have enough swap memory to build Slic3r by default. You will need to increase the swap size. To do this, run sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile and set CONF_SWAPSIZE=1000 then save and reboot. After reboot, run free -h and confirm that total swap size is around 1000MB.        Execute OctoPrint and go to Settings (or restart when you are asked after installing the plugin). Slic3r should appear in Plugins list:            In ‘General’, you should put the following path for the executable (supposing the execution of the script, the path would be /home/pi/Slic3r/slic3r.pl). Note: If running in Windows, write the path to slic3r-console:            Before importing the profile, you have to export a file with the Slic3r’s configuration. For that purpose, open Slic3r, and select File-&gt; Export Config…            Save the file with the desired name (e.g. config.ini):            Once done, in ‘Profiles’ click ‘Import Profile…’ button:            Click on ‘Browse…’ and search for the profile. Once done, save with the name and identifier wished by clicking ‘Confirm’:            Click ‘Save’ to confirm Slic3r settings:            Now you can slice your stl files:      ",

It currently requires the following hardware extensions:  A Tray consisting of a grid of boxes to store SMD parts in a defined position  A head camera to locate the exact part position on the tray  A (second) bed camera to precisely align the parts during the placing operation  A vacuum nozzle to grip partsOpenCV is used for the image processing part to measure exact positions and rotations of objects for accurate placing.For details and documentation please refer to the project’s github repository.This plugin is developed during a research project for integrated printing of electronics (wires and SMD-components) with FDM-printers.The development branch of the Slic3r extensions for routing circuits in a 3D-object by importing EAGLE schematics can be found at https://github.com/platsch/Slic3r/tree/electronics.",

Action commands are sent from the RepRap machine in the form //action:command.The plugin allows OctoPrint to execute a system command or send G-code to the printer in response to an action command.UsageAs of the latest Marlin bugfix-1.1.x version, the command M118 can be used to echo output to serial, meaning that M118 //action:dostuff would cause this plugin to try to handle the dostuff command when //action:dostuff was echoed back on the serial console.A future application of the plugin would be to add actions in the RepRap machine’s firmware so that hosts could respond.  For example, when Marlin is killed because something is wrong it would echo //action:poweroff and the attached OctoPrint instance could use this action command to trigger the printer’s power outlet to switch off.Action Command References  OctoPrint Documentation  RepRap Wiki",

"content": "Please note: OctoPrint Anywhere will be succeeded by The Spaghetti Detective, a faster and more powerful remote monitoring tool. It also detects print failures using AI. We strongly urge you to install that plugin instead.Why OctoPrint Anywhere?Do you want to have a quick glance at the realtime webcam feed of your running print while you are at work, grocery-shopping, or from any place with internet access?Do you wish you had an easy way to remotely adjust the temperature, cancel or pause the print in case things go wrong, all from your phone?If so, OctoPrint Anywhere is for you.OctoPrint Anywhere streams the webcam feed, bed/nozzle temperature, and other critical status from your 3D printer to your phone via the internet. Now you don’t have to be on the same WiFi network as the OctoPrint to monitor and control your 3D printer. No more messing with your router to set up port forwarding (a security risk too) or VPN.Highlights of OctoPrint Anywhere  Webcam feed on your phone. Extremely low latency (usually &lt;3s).  Real-time feed on temperatures and status of active print. Pause or cancel the active print.  Bandwidth-efficiency. Streams data only when you are watching. Data transmission immediately stops when browser tab goes to background.  Sharing realtime webcam feed with your friends with an encrypted link!  Access to your timelapses anywhere so that you can show them off! Sharing them too!  Remote control of X/Y/Z movement.  Seeing the IP address of your OctoPrint.

"description": "A plugin to update the built-in progress bar on your printer's LCD.",
"author": "Cesar Vandevelde",
"content": "Most 3D printers offer a progress bar or percentage indicator ontheir display. However, by default, this percentage is only updated whenprinting from SD card. When printing directly through OctoPrint, the progress barremains empty. This small plugin remedies the situation by injectingM73 (set build percentage) commands into the print stream.Note: Not all printers support this feature. In order for this to work, yourfirmware needs to understand the M73 command. See below for instructions forMarlin.Marlin FirmwareYou will need a recent version of Marlin, 1.1.7 or later. The M73 feature isnot enabled by default. You can enable it by uncommenting line 576 inConfiguration_adv.h:// Add an 'M73' G-code to set the current percentage#define LCD_SET_PROGRESS_MANUALLYConfigurationThe plugin should work as-is. Once enabled, the plugin will automatically injectM73 commands in the printer’s serial stream. There are two options to fine-tunethe plugin’s behavior, available through the M73 Progress tab in OctoPrintsettings.      Output time left: Sends the estimated time remaining using the R parameter.This is only supported by certain firmwares (e.g. Marlin 2.0 and Prusafirmware). This option is enabled by default; most firmwares will just ignorethis extra parameter if not supported.        Use time estimate: By default, the plugin uses OctoPrint’s built-in progressestimate, which is based on the progress inside a G-code file. In some cases,a better progress estimate can be calculated from the time elapsed and thetime remaining: P = elapsed / (elapsed + remaining). This option isparticularly useful forPrintTimeGenius users.  ",

"content": "Octolapse                                        The New and Improved Octolapse Tab            Octolapse is provided without warranties of any kind.  By installing Octolapse you agree to accept all liability for any damage caused directly or indirectly by Octolapse.  Use caution, and never leave your printer unattended.What Octolapse DoesOctolapse is designed to make stabilized timelapses of your prints with as little hassle as possible, and it’s extremely configurable.  Now you can create a silky smooth timelapse without a custom camera mount, no GCode customizations required.    \t                        A Timelapse of a Double Spiral Vase Made with Octolapse            Octolapse moves the print bed and extruder into position before taking each snapshot, giving you a crisp image in every frame.  Snapshots can be taken at each layer change, at specific height increments, after a period of time has elapsed, or when certain GCodes are detected.Important:  Octolapse requires OctoPrint v1.3.9 or higher, and some features require OctoPrint v1.3.10rc1 or above.  You can check your OctoPrint version by looking in the lower left hand corner of your OctoPrint server home page.  Python 3 users must install the Python 3 Development Package. See this guide for details.Getting StartedBe sure to read the Getting Started guide on the Octolapse Wiki.  This will save you a lot of hassle and allow you to unlock some of the best features of Octolapse.    \t                        View the Getting Started Guide Companion Video            Recent ChangesA lot has changed since the last release (v0.3.4).  Over 18 months of development and over 600 commits went into this newest version.  If you’ve had trouble installing or running Octolapse in the past, you just might want to try it again!I have been focusing on 3 items for V0.4:  Print Quality - This is my #1 concern, and a ton of effort has gone into reducing artifacts.  Print Time - Lots of folks have complained about the print time impact of Octolapse, and this is a totally legitimate concern.  This has been handled by adding new Smart triggers that minimize travel distance.  In fact, the new Smart - Snap To Print trigger completely eliminates travel moves from the stabilization!  Simplify Setup - Prior to V0.4, Octolapse was much more difficult to configure, especially for beginners.  Incorrect setup leads to poor print quality as well as extreme frustration.  This sad situation has been improved (but not completely solved) in several ways, including automatic slicer settings extraction and profile import/export/update functionality.Highlights of V0.4Python 3 and Octoprint 1.4.0 SupportOctolapse now runs on the newest versions of Python and is still backwards compatible with Python 2.7.  Additionally, Octolapse runs on the newest version of OctoPrint.Automatic Slicer Settings DetectionOctolapse can now extract all the required slicer settings directly from your GCode file.  You no longer need to copy your slicer settings into Octolapse before every print.  This is my favorite new feature!                                        Automatic Slicer Settings Configuration            Smart TriggersThe new smart triggers read your entire Gcode file before starting a print, giving them a lot more information to make better decisions.  They automatically detect print features and prefer to take snapshots over infill, wipe towers, or interior perimeters, and they avoid taking snapshots (where possible) over exterior perimeters.  They also try to start snapshots as close to the stabilization point as possible, reducing travel.  This all adds up to improvements in quality and a reduction in print time.  Plus, you will get to see a preview of your timelapse before your print starts.  Octolapse will inform you of potential problems and will help you to fix them.  If you don’t like what you see, you can cancel the print and change your settings, which will save you time and effort.                                        Smart Trigger Snapshot Plan Preview            Improved InterfaceThanks to UX advice from Derek73, the Octolapse tab has been greatly improved.  Highlights include:  a larger snapshot preview, shortcuts to the Octolapse settings pages, video and image file browsers, rendering progress, unfinished rendering recovery, new and improved informational panels, and a more intuitive design.                                        Improved UX            Import/Export/Download and Automatically Update SettingsOctolapse now has its own profile repository!  Access a library of pre-configured profiles and download, customize, and share your settings with the world!  You can export and import individual profiles or all of your Octolapse settings.  If newer settings are available from the repository, Octolapse will notify you and can automatically update any of the pre-configured profiles.                                        Import Profiles from the Repository            Enhanced Rendering CapabilitiesNow you can see detailed rendering progress and retry or alter renderings that never finished.  I added beta support for the H.265 codec (most Raspberry Pis don’t have the memory for this though).  I added new rendering overlay tokens, text outlining, and a default font for simplified setup.                                        Renderings in Process            Browse Videos and Image ArchivesI’ve finally added native file browsers to Octolapse!  Now you can download, sort, or delete timelapses, all without leaving the Octolapse tab.  If you enable the new archive images feature, you can also download snapshot images or re-render them using different settings.  I’ve even added the ability to upload images into Octolapse!                                        Videos and Images Browser            Better Camera ControlsOctolapse already included the ability to control camera settings like focus, exposure, and white balance.  In the new version, Octolapse detects your camera’s capabilities and renders a control page dynamically.  Octolapse even has enhanced custom control pages for some cameras (like the Raspberry Pi cameras and many Logitech models).  You can now watch your image change in real time as you adjust the settings.  You can even stabilize your extruder to make adjusting the focus a snap!  Requires mjpg-streamer.  Not compatible with Octoprint Anywhere or The Spaghetti Detective.                                        Custom Image Controls            Integrated Help SystemOctolapse now provides documentation for every single setting, and it’s all built-in.  Get your questions answered quickly by clicking on the help links (blue question marks).  Many error popups now also have a help button explaining what the problem is and how to fix it.  I’ve also added versioneer, including a link within the Octolapse tab that points directly to the release notes or commit specific to the version you have installed.    Help with Common Print Start Issues    Automatic Detection of Print Quality Issues, with Help    Integrated Help LinksImproved Camera Scripts and TestsBefore and After snapshot Gcode scripts allow you to run custom Gcode before and/or after every snapshot.  A new After Print Ends script is now available.  All bash/bat scripts now have test buttons making it much easier to test your custom scripts.    Additional Camera Scripts and TestsNew @OCTOLAPSE CommandsNow you can use Gcode to tell Octolapse when to take snapshots.  Prevent Octolapse from taking snapshots within your start/end Gcode with the new @OCTOLAPSE STOP-SNAPSHOTS and @OCTOLAPSE START-SNAPSHOTS commands.  You can also use the new @OCTOLAPSE TAKE-SNAPSHOT command to trigger a snapshot when using one of the GCode triggers.Alpha Support for Multi-Material/Multi-Extruder PrintersOctolapse now supports per-extruder/material slicer settings and offsets.  It’s even compatible with the Automatic Slicer Settings Detection feature.  This is an Alpha feature, so it is probably a bit rough since I don’t actually own a multi-extruder printer.Better LoggingI’ve added a custom module based logging system that should help with debugging.  You can also clear and download logs right from your Logging profile.  Exceptions are now logged automatically.  This enhancement is really for me, but I thought I’d mention it here.More Efficient Parsing and ProcessingIn order to make the new Smart triggers as fast as possible and to reduce the CPU load, I’ve created a new GCode parser and position processor entirely in C++.  This has increased performance by several orders of magnitude, especially when using the new Smart triggers.Faster SnapshotsOctolapse now captures snapshots more quickly and performs all image manipulations on a background thread.  This reduces print time and improves quality.G2/G3 (Arc) SupportOctolapse now supports Arc commands.  Now you can use the Arc Welder plugin with Octolapse.Support Octolapse DevelopmentPlease consider supporting my work by becoming a patron, a Github Sponsor, or by sending me beer money via PayPal.

To accomplish this I used the excellent and simple GCode System Commands plugin.  The timelapse worked great, but it required a lot of effort which I didn’t want to put in every time.  I received several requests for instructions on how to create a stabilized timelapse, so I decided to give plugin development a go.  At the time I had never written any OctoPrint plugins (or programmed Python or Knockout or anything open source), but I figured I could contribute something good to the community.On January 20, 2018, I released the  alpha version of Octolapse, and on March 24, 2018, I released the plugin on the OctoPrint Plugin Repository.  Octolapse grew up pretty quickly, and on November 15, 2018, I released V0.3.4.  Over a year and a half and 640+ commits later, I finally completed V0.4.0, which is a major rewrite of the software and includes all of the features discussed above.  It took a long time to get here.Octolapse is my “thank you” to all of the makers out there who have contributed time and effort to this hobby.  I hope that Octolapse can spread information about the 3D printing hobby by attracting a few new users.Report Problems and Suggest ImprovementsIf you think you have found a bug in Octolapse, please see this guide for reporting issues.

Please visit the homepage for more informations!Support my EffortsThis plugin, as well as my other plugins were developed in my spare time.If you like it, I would be thankful about a cup of coffee :)ATTENTION:  The layer information works only when the slicer adds “layer-indicator” to the g-code (CURA-Example as comments like ;LAYER:10). Then these indicators are parsed via a regular-expression.  Currently supported slicers: CURA, Simplify3D, KISSlicer. You can add your own layer-expressions in Plugin-Settings.If you want to use “slic3r”, see Enhancement #8  Sometimes there is a “Post Processing script” that deletes all comments (e.g. see Issue #33)  You need to upload your G-Code after installation of the plugin again (if you want to reuse already stored models in OctoPrint), because while uploading the G-Code is modfied  The total height “calculation” can be done in two ways: 1)the max Z-Value in the G-Code, 2) max Z-Value with extrusion in this height  The height/layer information is sometimes not matching with G-Code Viewer, because the viewer did a lot of “magic” (e.g. add extrusion diameter to height)For implementation details please visit the homepage.",

If your device have less than 512MB of ram your numpy installation will most likely fail. See #141 for solution.

"description": "Adds the ability to prevent printing within rectangular or circular regions of the currently active gcode file",
"author": "Brad Fisher",
"content": "Imagine running a long running, multi-part print job only to have one of the parts fail half-waythrough.  If you allow the job to continue, that big mess of spaghetti-like extrusions within thefailed area are likely to get stuck to other pieces and lead to additional failures or blemisheson the other parts (not to mention wasted filament) as the print goes on.The intent of this plugin is to provide a means to salvage multi-part prints where one (or more)of the parts has broken loose from the build plate or has otherwise become a worthless piece offailure.  Instead of cancelling an entire job when only a portion is messed up, use this pluginto instruct OctoPrint to ignore any gcode commands executed within the area around the failure.You can dynamically define rectangular or circular exclusion regions for the currently selectedgcode file through OctoPrint’s integrated gcode viewer, and those regions may be added or modifiedbefore, during, or even after printing.Some things to note about this plugin  It can only affect printing of files managed by OctoPrint, and can NOT exclude regions of filesbeing printed from your printer’s SD card.  Use the exclude feature at your own risk.  It is recommended to only use it when a portion ofyour print has already failed.  When defining regions, try to fully enclose all portions of the failed part that would otherwisestill print.  You will get unpredictable results if you only exclude a portion of a part, and anyoverhangs on higher layers that extend outside an excluded region will have nothing to supportthem.  This plugin makes several assumptions when filtering the gcode, some of which may not be correctfor your printer’s firmware.  It was developed with Marlin in mind, so should work reasonably wellwith firmware that replicates Marlin’s behavior.  The plugin only supports a single hotend at this time.  It is not recommended to attempt to useit on a gcode file with instructions for multiple hotends.  Users of TouchUI will not be able to create or modify exclude regions.  Any defined regions willbe displayed, but they cannot currently be manipulated on a touch device.Get HelpIf you experience issues with this plugin please use the issue tracker at the plugin’s Homepagelinked on the right.",

The “OctoPi Webcam URL” typically looks something like this:      http://192.168.10.79:8080/?action=stream      Terse setup information is also availabe via the expandable “Additional Information” section on the “Webcam Streamer” settings page.Advanced SetupAdvanced option allow for modification of the FFmpeg command line for use with other streaming services or cameras. It also allows for a different Docker container to be specified if desired or needed.      “Webcam Frame Rate” default is 5 frames per second which is appropriate for the Raspberry Pi webcam.        “Docker Image” default is adilinden/rpi-stream:latest. This value needs to match the docker image installed in the setup steps.        “Docker Container” default is WebStreamer. This value is rather arbitrary but the default makes sense (to me).        “FFmpeg Command” allows for customization of the ffmpeg command line.

Here’s the copy of the library documentation on how to do it:If you want to be able to use the library as a non root user, you will need to setup a UDEV rule to grant you permissions first. This can be accomplished as follows: $ sudo usermod -aG gpio &lt;current_user&gt; $ sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-gpio.rulesThat should add your user to the GPIO group, create a new UDEV rule, and open it in the Nano text editor. Enter the following into Nano   SUBSYSTEM==\"gpio\", KERNEL==\"gpiochip*\", ACTION==\"add\", PROGRAM=\"/bin/sh -c 'chown root:gpio /sys/class/gpio/export /sys/class/gpio/unexport ; chmod 220 /sys/class/gpio/export /sys/class/gpio/unexport'\"   SUBSYSTEM==\"gpio\", KERNEL==\"gpio*\", ACTION==\"add\", PROGRAM=\"/bin/sh -c 'chown root:gpio /sys%p/active_low /sys%p/direction /sys%p/edge /sys%p/value ; chmod 660 /sys%p/active_low /sys%p/direction /sys%p/edge /sys%p/value'\"press ctrl-x, Y, and ENTER to save and close the file. Finally, reboot and you should be ready to use OPi.GPIO as a non root user.Issues with OPI GPIO libraryhttps://github.com/rm-hull/OPi.GPIO/pull/28 solves the issues with PI GPIO library and the race condition that was preventing normal operations. It is available in release v0.3.4 and up so make sure you have latest OPI GPIO library.

It was bundled with OctoPrint up until version 1.3.10.  📝 Note  Versions of CuraEngine later than 15.04.x have changed their calling parameters in such a way that thisplugin is not compatible to it. For this reason, please use only CuraEngine versions up to and including 15.04,as available in the legacy branch of the CuraEngine repository on Github.The plugin offers a settings module that allows configuring the path to the CuraEngine Legacy executable to use, as well asimporting and managing slicing profiles to be used. Please note that the CuraEngine Legacy plugin will use the printer parametersyou configured within OctoPrint (meaning bed size and extruder count and offsets) for slicing.SetupInstall via the bundled Plugin Manageror manually using this URL:https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-CuraEngineLegacy/archive/master.zipFirst StepsBefore you can slice from within OctoPrint, you’ll need to  Install CuraEngine Legacy  Configure the path to CuraEngine Legacy within OctoPrint  Export a slicing profile from Cura &lt;15.04.x and import it within OctoPrintOctoPi ships with steps 1 and 2 already done, you only need to supply one or more slicingprofiles to get going :)If you are coming from an OctoPrint version prior to 1.3.11 and already had the then still bundled version of this pluginconfigured, your configuration &amp; profiles will be migrated.Installing CuraEngine LegacyYou’ll need a build of legacy branch of CuraEngine in order to be able touse the Cura Legacy OctoPrint plugin. You can find the legacy branch here.Compiling for RaspbianBuilding on Raspbian Jessie and later is as easy as:sudo apt-get -y install gcc-4.7 g++-4.7git clone -b legacy https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine.gitcd CuraEnginemakeAfter this has completed, you’ll find your shiny new build of CuraEngine in the build folder (full path for aboveexample: ~/CuraEngine/build/CuraEngine).Using Cura ProfilesThe CuraEngine Legacy Plugin supports importing your existing profiles for CuraEngine Legacy up to and including Cura 15.04.x. Newer CuraEnginereleases (e.g. 15.06 or 2.x) use a different internal format that will not work with the Cura Legacy Plugin.You can find downloads of Cura 15.04.x for Windows, Mac and Linux on Ultimaker’s download page.In order to export a slicing profile from the legacy Cura desktop UI, open it, set up your profile, then click on “File” andthere on “Save Profile”. You can import the .ini-file this creates via the “Import Profile” button in the CuraEngine Legacy Settingswithin OctoPrint.ConfigurationThe Cura plugin needs to be configured with the full path to your copy of the CuraEngine Legacy executable that it’s supposedto use. You can do this either via the CuraEngine Legacy plugin settings dialog or by manually configuring the path to theexecutable via config.yaml, example:plugins:  curalegacy:    cura_engine: /path/to/CuraEngine",

His plugin gets you 90% of the way there for adding Grbl support to Octoprint but had a couple limitations and lacked some bells and whistles from a UI and configuration perspective.Better Grbl Support utilizes mic159’s gcode receiver parser (with significant modifications) and does much, much more:  Replaces Octoprint’s Control tab with its own Grbl Control tab  Execute bounding box (framing) routines based on origin location and supplied dimensions  Computes selected file dimensions and pre-populates framing length/width fields  Converts Grbl error and alarm #s to meaningful descriptions  Grbl Homing support  Modify all Grbl ($$) settings via Better Grbl Support settings  Backup and restore Grbl ($$) settings  Click on the webcam image to enlarge it to its native resolution  Visually updates State / X / Y / Speed / Power dynamically, even while printing!  Weak Laser Toggle, Sleep, Reset, and Unlock buttons in the Grbl Control tab  Rewrites Octoprint’s annoying hardcoded M115 (Hello) queries as M5 requests  Rewrites M105 (temperature updates) as Grbl status updates  Suppresses M110 (reset line #) requests  Rewrites M400 (Finish moves) using Grbl Dwell  Rewrites M114 (current position) using Grbl Positioning  Implements M999 for reseting Grbl (^X)  Hides the Octoprint Control, Temperature and GCode Viewer tabs  Optionally adds Laser Commands and State sections to the Control tab  Suppresses status update reporting during GCODE streaming  No need to ignore firmware errors or track down other Octoprint nuance settings  Automatically disables Model Size Detection  Automatically disables sending checksums  Automatically disables the Printer Safety Check plugin  Most configuration options are accessible via Plugin SettingsSetupInstall via the bundled Plugin Manageror manually using this URL:https://github.com/synman/OctoPrint-Bettergrblsupport/archive/master.zipConfigurationThere are some meaningful caveats regarding the installation and configuration of this plugin.  If you use it in a multi-printer / profile environment it will very likely cause problems for your other profiles as it makes GLOBAL configuration changes behind the scenes.  A future version may resolve this, but understand that currently multi-profile installations are not currently supported.Furthermore, a number of global configuration changes are made blindly and I have no way of reverting these changes.  Be prepared to manually edit your config.yaml and/or manually revert global settings if you uninstall / disable this plugin to restore your Octoprint installation to its prior state.Pay special attention to the following config.yaml configuration parameters:  appearance / components / temperature tab  controls (any / all customizations made to it)  feature / temperatureGraph  feature / gcodeVisualizer  feature / modelSizeDetection  serial / neverSendChecksum  serial / checksumRequiringCommands  serial / helloCommand  plugins / _disabled / printer_safety_check  appearance / components / disabled / tab",

The model will be auto-rotated for a proper 3D print by the Tweaker-3 software.  The optimized model will be sliced using Slic3r.  The final machine code will be sent back to the octoprint server.  The printing can be started.Each step can be adjusted as described in the settings.Requirements  One server node that is connected to your 3D printer, like a Raspberry Pi.  One server node for pre-processing, which has at least 2GHz CPU frequency.If the node connected to the printer is strong enough, one server suffices.  Optional: Install Docker version 1.10.0+and Docker Compose version 1.6.0+on the more powerful node.Setup1. Install the PluginInstall the Octoprint-PrePrint Service in the Plugin Manager, e.g., from the archive’s URL https://github.com/christophschranz/OctoPrint-PrePrintService/archive/master.zipor manually using the git’s URL on the Printer-Controller2. Set up the (external) preprocess services in DockerIn order to make the service highly available, it is recommended to deploy thePrePrint-Service in Docker. If you are not familiar with docker yet,have a quick look at the links in the requirements-section.Then run the application locally with:git clone https://github.com/christophschranz/OctoPrint-PrePrintServicecd OctoPrint-PrePrintServicedocker-compose up --build -ddocker-compose logs -fOptional: The docker-compose.yml is also configured to run in a given docker swarm, adapt the docker-compose.yml to your setup and run:docker-compose builddocker-compose pushdocker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml preprintserviceThe service is available on localhost:2304/tweak(from the hosting node),where a simple UI is provided for testing the PrePrint Service.Use docker-compose down to stop the service. (If you ever wish :wink: )ConfigurationConfigure the plugin in the settings and make sure the url for the PrePrint service is setcorrect:Note that the octoprint URL must not be localhost, as the tweak-service is deployed ina docker network where it is unable to locate it’s hosts local network.Finally, go back to the home UI, click on the Slice-Button of uploaded STL-Models andproduce printable machinecode via this Preprocessing-Plugin.TestingTo test the whole setup, do the following steps:      Visit localhost:2304/tweak, select a stl model fileand make an extended Tweak (auto-rotation) without slicing. The output should bean auto-rotated (binary) STL model. If not, check the logs of the docker-serviceusing docker-compose logs -f in the folder where the docker-compose.yml is located.        Now, do the same with slicing, the resulting file should be a gcode file of the model.Else, check the logs of the docker-service using docker-compose logs -f in thesame folder.        Visit the Octoprint server, click on the Slice-Button of the uploadedSTL-Model in the file bar and produce printable machinecode via thisPrePrint-Service Plugin.. After some seconds a .gco file should be uploaded. Note that in a small time frame a.gco file with only one line and 83 bytes can appear. This is expected and should be overwrittenafterwards after a short time.If this doesn’t work, start the octoprint server per CLI with octoprint serveand track the logs.

"description": "OctoPrint plugin for OctoVox Amazon Alexa Integration",
"author": "John Ruzick",
"content": "The OctoVox plugin for OctoPrint sends limited printer information to a database for access via Amazon Echo devices.The problem with other Alexa solutions is that they require exposing access to your Octoprint server over the public internetas well as require providing the external service with your Octoprint API key.The OctoVox plugin eliminates that security risk by publishing only small informational status updates about your printerthat can then be retrieved by the Octovox Amazon Alexa Skill. This plugin and Alexa Skill do not allow any manipulation orcontrol over your printer, it is entirely read-only and secured via user accounts.OctoVox Plugin Installation and ConfigurationInstallation is super easy. There is no need to change your router configuration, doport forwarding or open holes in your firewall.  Download and install this plugin from the OctoPrint Plugin Repository or Github URL  Open the Settings tab of the OctoPrint-OctoVox Plugin  Enter a desired name for your printer  Click the Request Printer Registration button  You will be redirected to the OctoVox Login Page. If you do not yet have an account, click “Sign-Up” and enter a validemail address and create a password. You will have to verify your email address and then you will be directed to a pagethat will provide a unique key for your printer.  Enter that unique key in the box for Step 3 on the OctoVox Settings Page.  Click the Verify Registration button to make sure things were configured correctly.  After the info is verified, click Save.Alexa Setup  Use the Alexa companion mobile app or website to find and enable the Octovox Skill.  Once enabled, click on Settings and select Link Account.  Enter the Username and Password created in step 4 of the Plugin Configuration.  You can now ask Alexa for your printer status by saying “Alexa, ask my 3-D print server for my printer status”Setup Walkthrough\tPrivacyThis plugin uses two external services to function. A user management and registration portal, and an API/Database to store printer information.Upon successful configuration, your OctoPrint server will occasionally publish updates to the service via the API. These updates are securedusing your unique printer API key. This is NOT your OctoPrint API key! At no point will you need to provide your OctoPrint API key or Url, andyou do not need to expose your server to the public.Currently, the OctoVox service stores the following information which can be retrieved by Alexa:  Registration Email Address  Printer Name  Encrypted Printer Key Value  Printer Status (Offline, Operational, Printing, etc.)  Hot End Temperature  Bed Temperature  Current Job Completion Percentage  Current Job Z-height  Current Filename  Previous Job Duration  Previous Job Result (Completed, Cancelled, Failed, etc.)Printers that have not updated their status in 10 days will automatically be removed from the database and will have to be re-registered",

After the analysis has finished the metadata is written to the beginning of the file.If the gcode is uploaded the plugin stops the gcode analysis started by OctoPrint and looks whether the file contains such metadata or not. If metadata is found it will be added to the .metadata.yaml and the METADATA_ANALYSIS_FINISHED event will be fired. Otherwise the file will be analyzed by OctoPrint as usual by adding it to the analysis queue again.Installation of the analysis scriptGuides for Linux and Windows can be found in the wiki.",

Once values are received, you can view how to adjust your bed in a number of ways.  You click continue to proceed with another round of leveling or click finish to finish up.You have the option of viewing the values in a table view or overlayed on a photo of the heatbed.

This is default behavior for the Prusa Mini printer profile.The thumbnail image extracted will always be the last resolution provided in the thumbnail setting. So for example the Prusa Mini setting is thumbnails = 16x16,220x124 so the thumbnail that will be extracted will be 220x124 pixels as seen in the screenshots below. See the Configuration section below for additional details.The preview thumbnail can be shown in OctoPrint from the files list by clicking the newly added image button.The thumbnail will open in a modal window.If enabled in settings the thumbnail can also be embedded as an inline thumbnail within the file list itself.

Those can be found by selecting Show Configuration Folder from the Help menu of the application and then inside the printers sub-folder you’ll find your printer profiles.Update: PrusaSlicer has implemented setting the thumbnails in version 2.3.0-beta3.Update: SuperSlicer, an advanced fork of PrusaSlicer, now has image options in the Printer Settings as of version 2.2.53, big shout out to the team there. You must enable expert mode in order to see it. This plugin will use the big reoslution configured.Note: If you don’t see your printer’s ini file in the printers sub-folder; you are probably using one of the bundled Prusa Printer profiles (ie MK3S). If so you may need to create a copy of this printer profile to be able to have an ini file to edit. To do this in PrusaSlicer go to the Printer Settings tab and Click the save button next to the printer list and give it a new name. Alternatively, push Prusa Research to update their bundled profiles to match the Mini by commenting in the issue posted on their repository here.Open your desired printer profile in your favorite text editor and find the thumbnails = section and add the resolution that you would like to include in your sliced files, and therefore visible by this plugin. For example thumbnails = 16x16,220x124 will be the equivalent of the Prusa Mini as described above.Note: Once you’ve made your changes you will need to restart PrusaSlicer in order for the changes to be used and embed the thumbnails in the exported gcode files.Warning: the higher the resolution of the thumbnail you enter in this setting the larger your gcode file will be when sliced.Get HelpIf you experience issues with this plugin or need assistance please use the issue tracker at the plugin’s Homepage linked on the right.Additional PluginsCheck out my other plugins hereSupport My EffortsI, jneilliii, programmed this plugin for fun and do my best effort to support those that have issues with it, please return the favor and leave me a tip or become a Patron if you find this plugin helpful and want me to continue future development.

"author": "Blane Townsend",

API Request) to any URL when certain events happen on OctoPrint such as whena print starts, finishes, fails, …This plugin supports snapshot photos, OAuth, custom HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), custom headers, custom data and data format, custom encoding (json vs. x-www-form-urlencoded), and much more. It is very advanced and can send almost any kind of request to your server when an OctoPrint action occurs.Blog PostI wrote a blog post to explain more about what this plugin is and why I built it. Blog PostSetupInstall via the bundled Plugin Manageror manually using this URL:https://github.com/2blane/OctoPrint-Webhooks/archive/master.zipOnce you’ve installed the plugin, go to the settings page for this plugin. The page is called “Webhooks”.Select which events will trigger a webhook, then change the following:URLThe url that will be called when an event occurs such as https://www.myapi.com/v1/methodHTTP METHODThe type of HTTP request to make… Usually this is POST.CONTENT TYPEThis determines how the data is encoded before it is sent to your server. Usually, JSONwill work, but on some older systems x-www-form-urlencoded might be needed.NOTE: The proper HTTP header will be set for ‘Content-Type’ if you don’t supply one that allows the data to be sent properly. For instance, if you set the Content Type setting to JSON, then ‘application/json’ must appear somewhere your ‘Content-Type’ header. If ‘application/json’ does not appear in your ‘Content-Type’ header or is set to some other value, it will get replaced. So, you could set it to ‘application/json charset=utf8;’ if you wanted to, but not ‘application/yoyo’ as that would get replaced to ‘application/json’.API SECRETThis field is optional. If you want to provide a secret key/password that you can check on the server this is the easiest way to do that. For instance, if you set the API Secret to ‘abcdef123456’, then on your server you can check to make sure the API Secret is ‘abcdef123456’. If it is not, then the request came from something other than your OctoPrint Server and you should ignore the request (Somebody is trying to hack you!). Also, for security reasons you should set this to some long random string instead of something like ‘password’.DEVICE IDENTIFIERA name or id that you can provide to your printer to distinguish printers from each other. You can use this service with multiple printers using the same settings. Just set this device identifier to something different and you’ll be able to detect which printer sent the event.Webhook RequestBy default, the webhook will be called with the following data:{  \"deviceIdentifier\": \"the DEVICE IDENTIFIER in settings\",  \"apiSecret\": \"the API SECRET in settings\",  \"topic\": \"the name of the event - see below for events\",  \"message\": \"a description of the event - can be used for display purposes\",  \"extra\": {...} //a json object of data related to the event - different for each event}To change the format of the request, there are some advanced configuration parameters you can modify.Advanced ConfigurationHeadersProvide a JSON dictionary of HTTP headers that will be passed along with the request such as:{  \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"}DataProvide a JSON dictionary of parameters that will be passed along with the request such as:{  \"deviceIdentifier\":\"@deviceIdentifier\",  \"apiSecret\":\"@apiSecret\",  \"topic\":\"@topic\",  \"message\":\"@message\",  \"extra\":\"@extra\",  \"custom1\":\"my custom data\",  \"custom2\":\"my second piece of custom data\",  \"print_name\":\"@job.file.name\",  \"estimated_print_time\":\"@job.estimatedPrintTime\"}You can use @param syntax to insert variables into the JSON for both theHeaders and Data. For instance, if above you set ‘DEVICE IDENTIFIER’ to “Blane’s Printer”,then @deviceIdentifer will get replaced with “Blane’s Printer” when the webhook requestis made.You can also use dot notation to grab only parts of a dictionary. For instance,if there was a param named @job that contained the following:{  \"file\": {    \"name\": \"myFile.gcode\", //the name of your file    \"path\": \"/myFile.gcode\",    ...  }}Then, you could use the notation @job.file.name to just retrieve the file’s nameinstead of the entire dictionary.You can also use multiple @param variables in the same string. For instance:{  \"custom1\": \"@param1 some text here @param2 - @param3\"}Just make sure to put a space after each @param.See below for the list of available variables that you can use with the @param syntax.Available Variables@deviceIdentifier - the user set DEVICE IDENTIFIER found in settings@apiSecret - the user set API SECRET found in settings@topic - the type of event that was triggered. See below for a list of topics/events.@message - a short description of the type of event that was triggered.@extra - a dictionary of extra data that was passed along by OctoPrint. This dictionary depends on the event, but is usually something like the following:{  \"origin\": \"local\",  \"name\": \"myFile.gcode\",  \"user\": \"myUserName\",  \"owner\": \"owner of the file\",  \"path\": \"/someFolder/myFile.gcode\",  \"size\": 10890569}See this linkfor the data that is passed with each event.@state - a dictionary of data showing the current state of the printer{  \"text\": \"Operational\",  \"flags\": {    \"operational\": true,    \"printing\": false,    \"cancelling\": false,    \"pausing\": false,    \"resuming\": false,    \"finishing\": false,    \"closedOrError\": false,    \"error\": false,    \"paused\": false,    \"ready\": true,    \"sdReady\": true  }}See this linkfor more information.@job - a dictionary of data about the current print job{  \"file\": {    \"name\": \"DarwinKeycap.gcode\",    \"path\": \"DarwinKeycap.gcode\",    \"display\": \"DarwinKeycap.gcode\",    \"origin\": \"local\",    \"size\": 242038,    \"date\": 1588195405  },  \"estimatedPrintTime\": 476.05552375713864,  \"averagePrintTime\": 48.8202253183409,  \"lastPrintTime\": 31.290278981000007,  \"filament\": {    \"tool0\": {      \"volume\": 0.8077585001602579,      \"length\": 335.8269600000015    }  },  \"user\": \"iAmLegend\"}See this linkfor more information.@progress - a dictionary of data about the current print job’s progress{  \"completion\": 14.496484023169915, //percent complete  \"filepos\": 35087, //the current byte position in the file being printed  \"printTime\": 29, //seconds already spent printing  \"printTimeLeft\": 40, //seconds remaining  \"printTimeLeftOrigin\": \"average\" //how the time remaining was calculated.}See this linkfor more information.@currentZ - the current z height of the print head in mm.@offsets - any print offsets if applicable … otherwise an empty dictionary.@meta - a dictionary of metadata for the file you are printing.{  \"statistics\": {    \"averagePrintTime\": {      \"_default\": 49.04197595574509    },    \"lastPrintTime\": {      \"_default\": 50.53992706    }  },  \"hash\": \"2d2f2c6a410f8786b62604422799c9f3c0721367\",  \"analysis\": {    \"estimatedPrintTime\": 476.05552375713864,    \"printingArea\": {      \"maxZ\": 5.6,      \"maxX\": 136.67,      \"maxY\": 116.672,      \"minX\": 0.0,      \"minY\": -3.0,      \"minZ\": 0.0    },    \"dimensions\": {      \"width\": 136.67,      \"depth\": 119.672,      \"height\": 5.6    },    \"filament\": {      \"tool0\": {        \"volume\": 0.8077585001602579,        \"length\": 335.8269600000015      }    }  },  \"history\": [    {      \"timestamp\": 1588195498.7716029,      \"printTime\": 50.352958230999995,      \"printerProfile\": \"_default\",      \"success\": True    },    ...  ]}@currentTime - The time of the event in number of seconds since the epoch.The epoch is usually January 1 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC).@percentCompleteMilestone - The last percent complete milestone.Usually this is used with the Print Progress event for the message text.@snapshot - This is a special parameter that can only be used on the first levelof a dictionary. For instance, you can use it like this:{  \"snap\": \"@snapshot\"}but not like this:{  \"snap\": {    \"image\": \"@snapshot\"  }}The @snapshot parameter will be replaced with a jpeg image if a snapshot can be retrievedfrom your connected webcam.Make sure under FEATURES -&gt; Webcam &amp; Timelapse -&gt; the ‘Snapshot URL’ is set and working.This is what is used to grab a snapshot. The snapshot is then resized so that it can bequickly transported, and then sent along with your webhook under the key name you providedto the @snapshot parameter. If for some reason an image can’t be taken or there is an imageprocessing issue, then the @snapshot parameter’s key will be deleted and removed fromthe request. So, it is recommended that you make the image parameter optional on your server.NOTE: If you use the @snapshot parameter, the data will automatically be encoding usingmultipart/form-data and will override your settings and headers to match.NOTE: In some cases the data might not be available. For instance @meta.statistics.lastPrintTime might not exist. If this happens, the @param will be replaced with an empty string.Strategy - Getting all dataYou can copy and paste the following in the DATA box to get all the available data.Then, you can remove and rearrange things as necessary.{  \"deviceIdentifier\":\"@deviceIdentifier\",  \"apiSecret\":\"@apiSecret\",  \"topic\":\"@topic\",  \"message\":\"@message\",  \"extra\":\"@extra\",  \"state\": \"@state\",  \"job\": \"@job\",  \"progress\": \"@progress\",  \"currentZ\": \"@currentZ\",  \"offsets\": \"@offsets\",  \"meta\": \"@meta\",  \"currentTime\": \"@currentTime\",  \"snapshot\": \"@snapshot\"}Events / TopicsThe following is the list of topics that can trigger a webhook.  Print StartedThe print has started.  Print DoneThe print has finished.  Print FailedThe print has failed.  Print PausedThe print has been paused.  User Action NeededCalled on Prusa Printers when a color change is necessary.  ErrorAn error has occurred. Can refer to many different types of errors.  Print ProgressSends progress reports every ‘x’ percent where ‘x’ is defined by you.For instance, you can send a progress webhook every 10%, 25%, or 7% if you wanted. For instance, if you set ‘x’ to 5, then you would get a notification at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, …, 95%.NOTE: 0% and 100% are not triggered by this event, use ‘Print Started’ and ‘Print Done’for those events.Event DataFor details on what ‘extra’ data is provided with each event, check out the following.https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/events/index.html#printingOAuthOAuth is a common authentication mechanism used by many APIs.If your server requires you to first make an API call trading credentialsfor tokens so that you can use those tokens in your API request,then OAuth should be enabled. You can then access the properties of theOAuth response using something like @access_token in the DATA and HEADER settings foryour webhook request.Once you’ve ticked the box to enable OAuth, you’ll see some fields that you need tofill out such as the url to call, the HTTP Method, Content-Type, Headers, and Data.These work similar to the webhook settings, except you cannot use the @param sytax.When an event triggers a webhook, this OAuth request will be called first (if enabled).The response is expected to be JSON and will be parsed. All the keys in the JSON dictionarywill be available as @params that will be passed into the webhook request.For instance, if the reponse of the OAuth request was{  \"access_token\": \"abc123\",  \"refresh_token\": \"efg456\",  \"expires_in\": 3600}then you could use @access_token, @refresh_token, and @expires_in inside the‘DATA’ and ‘HEADERS’ Advanced Settings to pass them into your webhook request.TESTINGAt the bottom of the settings page, you can simulate events to test out your API and make sure everything is working. Just choose the event type and click the ‘Send Test Webhook’ button. You’ll see a popup message (usually in the top left of the screen) showing you the result of the webhook and if there were any errors. You’ll be notified if there are any JSON parsing issues with the settings you provided or any networking issues etc. The API requests that are sent are expected to return HTTP status codes between 200 and 399. Anything outside of that range will be considered an error.NOTE: If you see a popup telling you that settings need to be reloaded - ignore this. Don’t select an option, instead click outside the box on the screen. You can get into a weird state where you change the settings and they aren’t being updated. If this happens just refresh the page and try again.",

"author": "Anthony Stéphan",
"content": "This is the official plugin made for the Printoid for OctoPrint application.It aims to send you push notifications to your device(s) on specific events on your OctoPrint server.This plugin has been inspired by the great plugin made by the developer of OctoPod for iOS.He plugin (the original one) can be found here.If you like the Printoid Plugin, then please support the developer of the OctoPod plugin, because he did an amazing work!The Printoid Plugin communicates with Firebase Cloud Messaging server over a Google Cloud Function, located at the following URL:https://us-central1-firebase-printoid.cloudfunctions.net/printoidPluginGatewayPrerequisitesPrintoid v15.01 (at least) should be available and installed on your phoneWhat CAN this plugin do for you?This plugin sends immediate push notifications to your Android devices runningPrintoid for OctoPrint when:  The state of your printer is changing (to PRINTING, to PAUSED, to ERROR, and back to OPERATIONAL, for example)  The print job reached a certain progress (every 10%, every 25% or at 50% only)  Your print is now complete (progress = 100%)  Your print reached specified layers (requires plugin DisplayLayerProgress plugin to be installed too)  Your heated bed reached a specific temperature (useful to know when you can easily remove your prints from the bed, or when you can get smooth first layer)  Your extruder cooled down below a specific temperature (useful to be informed when you can safely turn off your printer)  Your printer has been paused because it requires a user action (out of filament, or manual multi color printing or M600 detection)  Palette 2 / Pro encountered a problem while printing  MMU requires user assistance (it requires Prusa firmware)  Firmware errors (get security alerts like thermal runaway, probing failed, min temp error, max temp error…)This plugin does not need your phone to be connected to the same network as your OctoPrint server to send the notifications.You will be able to receive the notifications even if you are out of your home and/or connected to the cellular network (3G/4G/5G) for example.This plugin does not need your network to be opened to the Internet. You do not need to do port forwarding, and you do not need to setup a VPN ;)Printoid does not need to be opened on your device to receive the notifications from the plugin. The app can be killed and your phone can be sleeping, you will receive the notifications whatever happens!What CAN’T this plugin do for you?This plugin is not a plugin to control your 3D printer remotely. Please be nice, don’t yell at me because this was what you expected…May be this will be possible in the future, but for the moment it would require me too much work.This plugin only sends push to your device in order to show you notifications on your device for specific events.This way it will not update the information contained in the app (at least for the moment).SetupInstall the plugin via the bundled Plugin Manageror manually using this URL:https://github.com/anthonyst91/OctoPrint-Printoid/archive/master.zipConfigurationOnce the plugin has been installed:  Open the Settings panel of OctoPrint  Navigate to the Plugins section and select Printoid Notifications  Open the Printoid application on your phone, and connect it to your OctoPrint server  Wait few seconds for the app to be fully refreshed  From the OctoPrint interface, click on the Send test notification button  Check on your phone, you should receive your first notification!  The Printoid app is now paired with the Printoid plugin, you will receive notifications!",

It has been programmed in conjuction with a camera gimbal mount design I published on Thingiverse here.It utilizes a custom @EASYSERVO &lt;GPIO NUMBER&gt; &lt;RELATIVE ANGLE DIFFERENCE&gt; command that can be incorporated within your slicer to automatically move while printing.Example: @EASYSERVO 12 10 will move the servo attached to GPIO 12 10 degrees in the positive direction from the current position. @EASYSERVO 13 -10 will move the servo attached to GPIO 13 10 degrees in the negative direction from the current position.Note: The servos will initialize at 90 degrees on OctoPrint start up and is limited to a 90 degree rotation in either direction.Pre-Installation RequirementsPlease follow the instructions here in order for this plugin to properly operate. Without these steps the plugin will not be able to control the GPIO pins on your Pi and as a result the servos will not move.SettingsThe plugin supports the ability to configure the GPIO number used for controlling the servos for the X and Y axes.DisclaimerAlthough I, iFrostizz, use this plugin and it works for me without issues, I take no resposiblity for any damage caused by using this plugin or connecting servos to your Pi.

"content": "Features      Support for Signal Messenger groups:    It’s possible to create a Signal Messenger group for every print job. That way, all the messages and webcam snapshots are nicely grouped together.        Support for Print Progress:    If enabled, a message will be sent when the print job progress reaches 20%, 40, 80%.        Support for all Print Events:    The plugin supports the Print Started, Print Failed, Print Cancelled, Print Paused, Print Resumed, Print Done events.        Support for signal-cli-rest-api:    The signal-cli-rest-api is a small REST API wrapper around the awesome signal-cli commandline tool. The main advantage is, that you don’t need to run signal-cli on the same host as your Octoprint instance. That’s especially useful, if you use other services in your home network (like Home Assistant) that also send Signal Messenger notifications.  InstallationThis plugin requires the signal-cli-rest-api docker container. Without the docker container, the plugin won’t work!

"description": "A plugin to securely access your OctoPrint instance remotely through ngrok",
"author": "fieldOfView",
"content": "This plugin creates a secure tunnel to access OctoPrint remotely. It provides a more secure alternative to using port forwarding to expose your OctoPrint instance to the internet.Forwarding a port and setting up a dynamic dns record unfortunately remains a popular way to make an OctoPrint instance accessible through the internet. This is very insecure (especially when not using HTTPS with a proper certificate), and requires changes to the local network (static IP for the OctoPrint instance, configuration changes to the router). The truly safe way to access an OctoPrint instance is to use a VPN, but this is hard to set up and properly configure.The OctoPrint Ngrok Tunnel plugin sets up a secure tunnel to your OctoPrint instance via the ngrok service. The tunnel is encrypted with SSL and proper certificates (even if your OctoPrint instance is not accessible via HTTPS locally), and is further protected with Basic Authentication (username and password) out of the box.There is no configuration of the local network necessary, and there are no ports to open or forward. No certificates to set up, and no changes to make to HAProxy. Just full access to your OctoPrint instance, including both the web interface and the API, from anywhere in the world. With the standard OctoPi confguration, you even get a working webcam stream remotely (if your home internet connection can keep up with the demands of streaming mjpeg).You only need to sign up for a free account at ngrok.com. There is one caveat: with a free account, you get assigned a random subdomain of ngrok.com, and this subdomain changes each time OctoPrint gets restarted. The tunnel address is shown within the OctoPrint interface, but it can also be looked up in the ngrok service dashboard. With a paid ngrok account, you can configure a static subdomain to use. A paid plan gives you additional features, such as using more than one tunnel (printer) and creating an IP whitelist to limit who can access the tunnel.ConfigurationThe Ngrok Tunnel plugin can be configured via the OctoPrint settings panel.The ngrok auth token is used to authenticate you on the ngrok service and can be found by logging in to the ngrok dashboard. Though not strictly required for an ngrok tunnel, the plugin requires you to set up Basic Authentication on the tunnel in addition to the access control already set up on your OctoPrint instance. Any username and password combination can be chosen, but it is recommended to use a different username and password than your OctoPrint credentials. If you wish, you can use the same username and password you use for logging in to OctoPrint and have the login to the tunnel automatically log you in to OctoPrint too.DisclaimerThe authors of the plugin have no affiliation with ngrok. The plugin uses pyngrok by Alex Laird to setup and manage ngrok tunnels.Security is a serious topic, especially when there’s a 3d printer involved. This plugin is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind.

"content": "Consolidated TabsThis plugin will allow you to combine the selected tabs into a single tab as draggable and resizable panels. Click the screenshot below to see an example YouTube video.\tNote: Initial positioning and sizing can be difficult due to the relative positioning of the panels. You may have to drag/resize and refresh the page a couple of times to get everything perfectly aligned. See Tips below for more information.SettingsClick the screenshot below to open a YouTube video demonstrating setting up Consolidated Tabs.\t  Snap to Edges While Dragging: if enabled panels will snap to the edges of other panels while dragging.  Combined Tabs Order: all the tabs that will be combined into one tab as a panel.  Uncombined Tabs: tabs that have not been combined and will remain as their own tab.  Resize Navbar: whether to resize the width of the top navbar to 100% or not.  Remove Tab Name: don’t show the name of the consolidated tab, only possible if all tabs are combined.  Use Full Width of Browser: if enabled the tab area will be sized to fit the entire width of the browser and the sidebar will be moved to the left.  Clear All Positions and Sizes: use the buttons to clear all position or size customizations, helpful when panels get moved off screen.Tips      The name of the tab will match what is configured in OctoPrint’s Title appearance setting.        The best way to get your panels sized and positioned is to order them in the plugin’s settings first in the order that you want the panels to be in the consolidated tab. The panels will wrap from left to right and top to bottom in that order.    Hold down the shift key on your keyboard and click anywhere on a panel (typically in blank space or on header) to activate it. Once activated you can let go of the shift key.          Move panels by clicking and dragging the panel header.      Resize panels by clicking and dragging the edges of the panel.      Once finished click any panel to deactivate the currently active panel.            Each panel is positioned relative to the panel that precedes it in settings, and as a result resizing a panel will cause the other panels to move, and potentially wrap if they extend past the containing tab.    There are circumstances in which a panel may jump out of view while dragging/resizing panels. If this happens you can use the Clear Positions button in the plugin’s settings to make all the panels realign to each other.ThemeifyIf using Themeify you will want to add extra settings to your Advanced options. These are the relevant css selectors that you will need to adjust.To-Do[ ]  Figure out how to get rid of the extra whitespace at the bottom of the page after panels are positioned.Get HelpIf you experience issues with this plugin or need assistance please use the issue tracker at the plugin’s Homepage linked on the right.Additional PluginsCheck out my other plugins hereSupport My EffortsI, jneilliii, programmed this plugin for fun and do my best effort to support those that have issues with it, please return the favor and leave me a tip or become a Patron if you find this plugin helpful and want me to continue future development.

"author": "Anni Lange",
"content": "Octoprint-Smart-Filament-SensorOctoPrint plugin that lets integrate Smart Filament Sensors like BigTreeTechs SmartFilamentSensor directly to RaspberryPi GPIO pins. This enables that this sensor can also be used on 3D Printers, that do not have a E0-Stop like e.g. Creality 1.1.4 Mainboard of Ender 3.Initial work based on the Octoprint-Filament-Reloaded plugin by kontakt.Fork of Octoprint-Filament-Revolutions plugin by RomRider.The solution for this plugin is inspired by Marlin FirmwareRequired sensorTo use this plugin a Filament Sensor is needed that sends a toogling digital signal (0-1-0…) during movement.This plugin can use the GPIO.BOARD or GPIO.BCM numbering scheme.Features  Configurable GPIO pins.  Support movement detection sensors, e.g. Smart-Filament-Sensor.  Detect if filament is not moving anymore (jammed or runout)          Detection based on timeout      Detection based on filament position returned bei M114 (unfortunately imprecise compared with firmware)      Alternative pausing commands if M600 is not supported by the printer      Installation  Install via the bundled Plugin Manager.  Manually using this URL: https://github.com/maocypher/Octoprint-Smart-Filament-Sensor/archive/master.zipAfter installation a restart of Octoprint is recommended.ConfigurationGPIO Pin  Choose any free GPIO pin you for data usage, but I would recommend to use GPIO pins without special functionalities like e.g. I2C  Run the sensor only on 3.3V, because GPIO pins don’t like 5V for a long timeDetection timeCurrently it is necessary to configure a maximum time period no filament movement was detected. This time could be depended on the print speed and maximum print line length. For the beginning - until I figured out how to estimate the best detection time - you can run a test print and messearue your maximum time and configure this value.The default value 45 seconds was estimated on max. print speed 10mm/s, for faster prints it could be smaller.Detection distanceVersion 1.1.0 of this plugin detects the movement depending on the moved distance. Therefore it is necessary to configure a distance without movement being detected. In Marlin Firmware the default value is set to 7mm. According to this the value is set for the plugin.Sampling timeTo reduce the negative effects on the print quality a sampling time must be set. Periodically M114 code is sent to the printer to receive the current filament position. This increases the load on the printer, i.e. if the sampling time is set to small the printer starts stuttering, because it cannot process all commands fast enough. I  assume the value could differ according to the mainboard architecture (8-bit or 32-bit).Octoprint - Firmware &amp; ProtocolSince currently GCode command M600 is used to interrupt the print, it is recommended to add M600 to the setting “Pausing commands”.Since v1.1.3 there are also alternative pausing commands [M0, M1, M25, M226, M600, M601] available, for those whose printer don’t support M600.Octoprint - GCode ScriptsIf you do not want that the print is paused right on your print, I recommend to add a GCode Script for “After print job is paused”. Also adding GCode script “Before print job is resumed” might be useful, in the case you hit the heatbed or print head during the change of the filament or removing the blockage.Disclaimer  I as author of this plugin am not responsible for any damages on your print or printer. As user you are responsible for a sensible usage of this plugin.  Be cautious not to damage your Raspberry Pi, because of wrong voltage. I don’t take any responsibility for wrong wiring.Outlook  Integrated sensor connection test  Support of multiple sensors for multiextruders like 4 channel kraken hotendContact  Issues  Smart-Filament-Sensor Discord  Octoprint Discord",

You can see all of your printers and their respective tokens here.  Test your token using the Activate button adjacent to the input box.  You are all setup. Happy printing!Installation with WebRTC for live video streamsOctoPrint-Mattacloud uses WebRTC to enable real-time video streams from the printer to your device. In order to utilise this capability a few additional packages need to be installed on your Raspberry Pi (or other device) running OctoPrint. These packages are not required for using the main features of the plugin.If you are not using the Mattacloud SD image then you need to install the following packages:sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libavfilter-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev python-dev python3-dev libsrtp2-dev libsrtp2-1 libopus-dev libvpx-dev pkg-configThese packages are required for OpenCV and are also needed to build pylibsrtp a requirement of aiortc for WebRTC.Once you have installed the above packages you can activate your Python 3 virtualenv where OctoPrint is installed. It will be something like source oprint/bin/activate. Then install the following using pip:pip install aiohttp==3.6.2 aiortc==0.9.7 numpy==1.19.1 opencv-python==4.4.0.40or if you have the plugin downloaded / cloned you can use:pip install -r webrtc_requirements.txtWhen the plugin has installed, restart OctoPrint and begin the Printer Setup process outlined below.Report problemsIf something does not appear to be working correctly and you think you may have found a bug in the OctoPrint-Mattacloud Plugin, please create an issue on the official page here. In this way your issue can be understood and fixed quickly.Or feel free to contact us via whatsthematta@mattalabs.com.Error detection and process monitoring3D printers are not the most reliable of machines. All of us have suffered from errors whilst printing and many users find themselves handcuffed to their printers, having to constantly check the printer every 5 minutes to make sure that the print is still okay! If this sounds familiar to you… hopefully this plugin will help.Numerous computer vision techniques are used to determine if an error has occurred during your 3D print. Using a mixture of machine learning, 3D printing heuristics and the direct comparison of g-code to the current state of the 3D print, an errors are reliably determined in an image of the print.Errors that the personal and industrial plans are capable of detecting are:  Detatchment from print bed  Offset  Warping  Poor bed adhesion  Spaghetti  Blocked extruder / out of filament  Hotend too close to print bedAt present, the Beta plan does not support error detection as we are still testing our AI models in house. To be released by the end of 2020!Remote control and managementAccess your 3D printer from anywhere in the world (provided that there is an internet connection…) via the OctoPrint-Mattacloud Plugin.At present, the plugin enables you to do the following:  View and update hotend, bed and chamber temperatures  Control and home X, Y and Z axes  Select prints to retrieve information  Start, cancel, pause, resume and restart 3D prints  Upload g-code files remotely to your printer for printing  Delete g-code files remotely  Receive the latest images/snapshots from your printer  See your prints progress (time remaining and percentage completion)Notifications and updatesBy installing this plugin and linking a printer to your Mattacloud account, you can receive useful notifications and updates concerning your 3D printer via various channels. When an error occurs during the 3D printing process, you will receive an alert with an attached image showing the error in addition to current progress, material usage and other useful statistics; you can then deside to take action. Additionally, you can also set up other checkpoints to receive notifications, such as upon object completion, or when a print has reached the half way mark.The communication channels which are currently supported are:  Email (in Beta plan)  SMS (personal and industrial plans)  WhatsApp (personal and industrial plans)  Facebook Messenger (personal and industrial plans)LicenseView the OctoPrint-Mattacloud plugin license",

"content": "Arc Welder: Anti Stutter and GCode Compression                            The Arc Welder Tab            How To Use Arc WelderPlease read the readme file in the Github Repository for installation and usage instructions.  I am planning to add a complete wiki for the plugin in the near future and will link to that here when it is complete.Please note that if you are using Python 3, you may need to install the python3-dev package before Arc Welder will install. This is detailed in the prerequisites section of the readme file linked to above.Support Arc Welder DevelopmentPlease consider supporting my work by becoming a patron, a Github Sponsor, or by sending me beer money via PayPal.  Almost all of the donations go towards offsetting the cost of development, which is substantial. Plus, it always makes my day!  If you cannot afford to leave a tip or just don’t want to, that is fine too! Arc Welder is free and open source after all.What Arc Welder DoesArc Welder attempts to replace G0/G1 (linear move) GCodes with G2/G3 (arc move) GCodes.  This can substantially compress many GCode files and may reduce stuttering caused by sending many tiny movements in rapid succession over a slower serial connection.  Here is an example of the before and after of a single layer of a cylinder with archimedean infill produced by PrusaSlicer:                            Before:  GCode generated by PrusaSlicer.  After: GCode processed by ArcWelder.  Visualized with ncviewer. View the Full Sized Image.    Each dot in the image above represents the start or endpoint of an extrusion.  You can see that the After GCode above has far fewer moves. The processed GCode is 76.1% smaller with 96.4% fewer extrusion/retraction commands than the original file.  Detailed statistics are created and stored for each GCode file processed:                Statistics of the arc-welded file, showing a substantial reduction in file size and extrusion/retraction moves.    The results above are not typical since the source file is almost entirely circular.  A better real world example, the first layer of the famous 3DBenchy, sliced with PrusaSlicer using archimedean infill is shown below:                            Before:  GCode generated by PrusaSlicer.  After: GCode processed by Arc Welder.  Visualized with ncviewer.  View the Full Sized Image.    The result is a GCode file that is 56.2% smaller (2.3 compression ratio) with 75.0% fewer extrusion/retraction commands.  In this case, Arc Welder shows a massive decrease in small extrusion moves between 0.01mm and 1mm in length:   Min          Max   Source  Target  Change--------------------------------------------  0.000mm to   0.002mm     0      0     0.0%  0.002mm to   0.005mm     0      0     0.0%  0.005mm to   0.010mm     0      0     0.0%  0.010mm to   0.050mm     7      1   -85.7%  0.050mm to   0.100mm    29      6   -79.3%  0.100mm to   0.500mm  1342     74   -94.5%  0.500mm to   1.000mm   810    114   -85.9%  1.000mm to   5.000mm   145    341   135.2%  5.000mm to  10.000mm     1     25  2400.0% 10.000mm to  20.000mm     2     14   600.0% 20.000mm to  50.000mm     8      8     0.0% 50.000mm to 100.000mm     2      2     0.0%          &gt;= 100.000mm     2      2     0.0%--------------------------------------------       Total distance:............1929.879mm   Total count source:..................2348   Total count target:...................587 Total percent change:................-75.0%How Arc Welder WorksArc Welder reads each GCode in the source file, searching for three extrusion or retraction commands in a row.  It adds adds these points to a special shape detection class that determines if the collected points can be represented by an arc command (G2/G3).  Once an arc is detected, Arc Welder compares the original GCode path with the resulting arc command to ensure that any deviation is within the specified resolution (by default, +-0.025mm).  Arc Welder will continue to add new points to the arc until it detects either a significant deviation from the original GCode or a change in the printer’s state (a new layer, a feedrate or offset change, etc.).  It will then pull off the final point from the arc, output the altered G2/G3 command, and continue to process the file.  The resulting GCode will not vary from the source file by more than half of the specified resolution, which is configurable.  Here is a rudimentary illustration:                            An illustration of how arcs are generated.  View the Full Sized Image.    In the example above, Arc Welder has created two arcs.  The first arc starts at P1 and ends at P5 on the blue line. The original path is shown in red.  In this example Arc Welder first adds three consecutive points (P1-P3) to its shape detection class and determines that the generated arc does not deviate significantly from the original path.  It then adds P4 and P5, again detecting no significant deviation.  However, at P6, the detected deviation exceeds the maximum, so P6 is not added, and an arc is generated that replaces P1-P5.  Arc Welder then starts a new arc from P5, P6, and P7 and continues the process.  Note:  The endpoints of every arc will ALWAYS line up exactly with the original GCode.It is important to note that the example above is zoomed WAY in so that the deviation looks very large.  It is, in fact, extremely small and almost impossible to see with the naked eye.  You can customize the resolution in the plugin settings if 0.05mm (+- 0.025mm) is too large for you.Arc Welder Plugin Features  Customizable Resolution - You control the maximum allowable deviation from the original tool path.  Higher values will result in more compression but more deviation.  Lower values will produce more accurate GCode but less compression.  The default value of 0.05mm (+- 0.025mm) produces excellent results in most cases.  I would recommend a lower value only for extreme cases, like extremely high resolution models with small nozzles and very low layer heights.  Values higher than 0.05 are not recommended.  Automatic and/or Manual Processing - Arc Welder can be configured to automatically process newly added file or to allow manual processing via an integration with the OctoPrint file manager.  You can enable one or both of these methods depending on your preference.  Rename or Overwrite the Source File - Choose to keep the original source GCode file or replace it entirely with the arc-welded file.  You can also add a custom prefix or postfix to the output file.  Delete the Source File After Processing - You can create a new file and have Arc Welder delete the original file automatically in most cases.  See Detailed Conversion Statistics - Arc Welder creates and stores statistics for each converted file, including compression percentage and ratio, source/target file size, and line count, as well as a detailed comparison of extrusion/retraction counts at various lengths between the source and target file.  You can view statistics for any arc-welded file by selecting it in the file manager or by clicking on the icon within the file manager.  Detailed Conversion Progress Bar - See real time progress info as Arc Welder processes your file, including several useful statistics.  You can cancel the conversion at any time.  Enable/Disable Notifications - Tired of popup messages?  Turn them off in the settings.  Advanced Logging Settings - You can control logging from within the plugin’s settings page if you run into problems.  You can even delete the existing log(s) completely.  Restore Plugin Defaults - Easily restore the default settings if you run into trouble.  Receive Notifications for New Development or Maintenance Release Candidates - Get early notifications about new features and bug fixes.  Help contribute to the project!  Arc Welder also supports plugin-specific release channels in a future version of OctoPrint (if that feature is eventually released).Arc Welder Library and Console ApplicationThe core of the Arc Welder plugin is a set of libraries written in c++ based on code that was originally designed for the Octolapse plugin.  This code allows Arc Welder to parse GCode and determine the printer’s position and extruder state after each command.  Since the code is written entirely in c++, it is orders of magnitude faster than similar code written in Python.  The complete source, as well as a console version and inverse processor (convert G2/G3 to G0/G1), can be found here.  There are also pre-compiled binaries, though I’ve not gotten them to work properly in MacOS or in some flavors of Linux.  There are currently no GitHub hosted runners for any Raspberry Pi.  I am working on these issues.Using the console application, it is possible to arc-weld files via most slicers as a post-processor.  However, all slicers that I have tested except for Simplify 3D fail to correctly visualize the G2/G3 commands.  Simplify 3D does seem to work perfectly for this, but other slicers make it look like the GCode is faulty.  Keep that in mind if you plan to integrate the Arc Welder Console Application with your slicer.Firmware ConsiderationsYour printer’s firmware must be capable of printing G2/G3 commands to use the GCode produced by Arc Welder.  Additionally, arc support must be enabled and properly configured.  Firmware support varies, and many older versions produce arcs less accurately and more slowly than expected.MarlinMarlin has supported arc commands for a long time.  However, starting with version 2.0.6 arc support has been greatly enhanced.  I recommend you upgrade to at least this version before using Arc Welder because your experience will be much better.  Arc support must be enabled in your Configuration_adv.h file.For recent versions of Marlin (2.0.6 and above), you can send an M115 to see if your firmware has ARC_SUPPORT enabled.  For earlier versions you can send an empty G2 or G3 command.  If your printer responds with unknown command, arc support is not enabled.If your printer is running a fork of Marlin, but arc support is not enabled or is buggy, I recommend creating an issue within the fork’s repository.  “A plugin that can convert curves into arcs will be massively welcome and should make a great improvement in performance and print results.”  Scott Lahteine - Creator of Marlin FirmwarePrusa FirmwarePrusa’s fork of Marlin does support G2/G3 commands, however the default settings can produce sharp corners for very small arcs.  I’ve only noticed this in a few of my test prints, so it is not a particularly common issue.  You should be able to see it on the roof of a Benchy if you look closely.  Reducing the MM_PER_ARC_SEGMENT setting slightly can correct this but can also introduce stuttering.  Reducing the value massively (say to 0.1mm) will introduce a LOT of stutter and is NOT recommended.  Please note that adjusting this setting currently requires a manual firmware recompile.I have been toying with the firmware and have submitted a pull request to enhance the capabilities, but it hasn’t made it into the firmware yet and may require further modifications.  I am planning to add some enhancements from Marlin 2.0.6 as well.  I also added some new GCodes for adjusting arc interpolating and for retrieving the firmware settings for arc generation.  You can view the pull request here.  Feel free to give this pull request a thumbs up, but realize that it needs some work and that the good folks at Prusa Research have a lot on their plates.Also, some very old versions of Prusa’s firmware (I’m not sure exactly how old) do not support bed leveling adjustments during arc movements.  Please make sure you are using a recent version of the firmware so that interpolated movements are properly leveled.KlipperKlipper seems to handle G2/G3 commands with ease, as long as the GCode_arcs config section is enabled.  G2/G3 support was added on September 13, 2019, so make sure you update Klipper if you are using an older version.Other FirmwareThough G2/G3 support is not universal, nor are all implementations equal, it is relatively easy to test.  You can do so in the OctoPrint terminal by sending the the following commands, one at a time:G90G28 X YG0 X0 Y0G2 X40 I20If your printer supports arc commands, it should move across a small arc from the origin.  Please feel free to let me know if your firmware supports arc movements, and I may add it to the list.Warning:  The above GCode has not been tested on all printers.  Please use it with caution and report any issues here.Other Firmware ConsiderationsMost firmware will convert G2/G3 commands to many small segments through a process called interpolation.  The length of these segments varies by implementation.  In most cases the interpolated segments are much closer together than the linear segments you will find within your GCode file, but it’s impossible to know for sure without examining the firmware in detail.All firmware that I am aware of will inscribe these interpolated segments within the arc.  These segments will be entirely within the arc, only touching it at the endpoints.  This will reduce the average radius slightly.  In most cases, this effect is minimal and has no practical impact.  However, in some odd cases, like a snap fitting that is extremely sensitive to changes in diameter, the effect may be noticeable.  The smaller the interpolated segments (all firmware controlled), the less of an effect there is.  In general, it will be a much smaller effect than normal variations in filament diameter.  I hope to find a solution to this problem.G2/G3 support is not perfect at the moment, but I suspect things will start to improve as they become more common.  If you are willing and have the skills to improve G2/G3 support in any way, please do!LicenseView the Arc Welder license.",

"author": "eyal0",
"content": "This plugin requires OctoPrint-PrintTimeGenius.TimeToFilament can show you the time until the next filament change inyour print.  It can also show the time until your next layer willstart.  In fact, it’s extensible and can show you whatever you want ifyou configure it through the settings!How it works:TimeToFilament scans through your gcode looking for a line that youspecify.  Then it parses the text on that line and sends it to yourbrowser along with how many seconds until the printer will reach thatline.  Your browser will use that to create some text to display rightbelow the total time to print.If you know how to write a regularexpression, you can make your own.  If youneed this and have trouble with it, file a request.http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugin/TimeToFilament/",

"description": "A plugin that allows common printer actions to be performed with physical buttons via GPIO",
"author": "Mark Lorenz",
"content": "OctoBuddy is 3D printable button panel with an accompanying OctoPrint plugin that lets perform common printer actions like moving your print head with the push of a single button.  It let’s you speed up things like maintenance, troubleshooting, and filament changes much quicker and easier by bypassing the need to access OctoPrint interface or cumbersome printer menus.  The concept is simple, connect a button to the Raspberry Pi GPIO interface and tell the plugin which what action you want the port to perform.  You can mount your buttons to one of the  my button panels  or make your own.OctoBuddy can currently perform the following actions:    Home Printer    Jog any Axis by a configurable distance    Toggle bed temperature between a configurable temperature and 0    Toggle nozzle temperature between a configurable temperature and 0For a full how-to on building your own OctoBuddy go here: https://www.factoryrestart.com/octobuddyI build these things cause I like it.  I make them available to you because… well, why not.  If you like my work and would like to donate just click here.  All contributions are much appreciated.",

There is a Test button that will run the command and let you validate the returned data. At the moment the returned data has to be a number (float or integer) and will be fixedIf the plugin has detected any known ways of finding interesting data on startup this will be shown in Predefined dropdown button.At the moment it only looks for known CPU temperature, but if you know of any good generic ways to display interesting data then post it here https://github.com/LazeMSS/OctoPrint-TopTemp/issues3RD Party software  http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/index.htmlThis plugin uses the wonderful CHARTIST.JS library to make the svg graphs",

"description": "Automatic G-Code Compression",
"author": "Scott Mudge",
"content": "MeatPackEasy, fast, effective, and automatic g-code compression!MeatPack is a plugin which automatically compresses/packs outgoing g-code to compatible firmware (*see below!). It uses a unique data packing method which leverages the limited character-set inherent to most g-code. It is able to pack the most common characters in g-code into 4-bit blocks, while also retaining the ability to send full-width characters where needed. It also has the option to strip outgoing whitespace characters for an even greater compression ratio (ensure your firmware supports this).It compresses/packs outgoing g-code by a ratio of 0.55 (or 0.61 without whitespace removal enabled). Meaning that what would normally be a 115,200 baud connection effectively becomes a 210,000 baud connection, with no changes to hardware. And it does all this with virtually zero computational overhead, so it is compatible with even the most speed-limited 16-MHz controllers.MeatPack does require firmware support!, so do NOT install this plugin without first upgrading your firmware to a compatible build (where available). If you do not have a compatible firmware and install this plugin, connection to your printer may fail.Firmware with MeatPack Support:To check if your firmware has MeatPack support, please check here: https://github.com/scottmudge/OctoPrint-MeatPack#firmware-with-meatpack-supportAdding support is fairly straight-forward, so if you’d like to add support into other firmware, please contact me and I can provide the latest firmware-side source code (also available in Prusa fork above).",
