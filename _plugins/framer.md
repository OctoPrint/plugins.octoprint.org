## Description
This plugin adds a button to verify the working area of a Gcode on a CNC or Laser cutter.
It works by extracting the maximum and minimum X and Y and sending a G0 code to move the CNC/Laser to the corner locations.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html) or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/rriet/OctoPrint-Framer/archive/master.zip

## Usage
### Configuration
After installation restart OctoPrint, go to the Settings tab and set the CNC/Laser movement speed.

### Frame function
- Connect to the CNC/Laser
- Upload and load the Gcode file
- Home the CNC/Laser or use a G92 code to set the origin point
- Click the Frame button
- Observe the movement of the CNC/Laser to see where the work area is on the plataform. Be ready to stop the machine to avoid colisions.

## Warmings: 
- The plugin will not move the Z axis
- Make sure the area is clear to avoid colisions.
