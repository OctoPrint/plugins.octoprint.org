## Easily Monitor Your Prints from Anywhere

The Polar Cloud at https://polar3d.com is accessible from anywhere, inside or
outside of the printer's local network.

## Print Queue

You can prepare multiple prints, queue them up and send them one by one to your
printer

## Manage Multiple Printers

You can connect more than one printer to your Polar Cloud account and manage
them all from one place.

## Object Library

You can upload your objects to Polar Cloud, share them with other cloud
members, and send them to your printer.

## IFTTT

Polar Cloud is an IFTTT service, so you can easily set things up to happen when
various events happen with your printer connected to Polar Cloud.

## Getting Started

There's a few steps to get up and running (beyond installing the plugin).
Please read the additional info in the [README](https://github.com/markwal/OctoPrint-PolarCloud/blob/master/README.md)
