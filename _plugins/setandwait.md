##### Benefits:
- Prints can be canceled during the heating phase without waiting for the temperature to be reached.
- Fixes an issue where Smoothieware only reports temperatures for the probe being heated which in turn causes gaps on the OctoPrint temperature graph for other probes. 
- Works around odd behavior in Klipper where setting the temperature to a lower value will result in waiting for the heater to cool instead of simply continuting (S being treated as R). See [KevinOConnor/klipper#1108](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/issues/1108)
