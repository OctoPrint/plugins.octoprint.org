Matrix notifier sends messages to a configured matrix room with information about your print and snapshots of your camera.

The following events are configurable through the web UI:

  - PrintStarted
  - PrintPaused
  - PrintFailed
  - PrintDone
  - Print Progress

The message templates support markdown which are converted to HTML to send as formatted matrix messages.

In addition to this any other event should be configurable directly in the `config.yaml` file.

Take the event name from https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/events/ and add a section under the `plugins:` section which looks like this:

```
  matrix_notifier:
    events:
      Connected:
        enabled: true
        template: |
          ## Printer Connected
```

This would send messages on the "Connected" event. Find the existing section of the config and edit it where appropriate rather than adding new sections.
Note that not all events have been tested, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Cadair/octoprint-matrix-notifier-plugin/issues/new) if you encounter an issue with a specific event.
