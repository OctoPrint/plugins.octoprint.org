This viewer adds support for CNC toolpaths, which have no extrusions.  
This plugin is based \(very\) heavily on the native OctoPrint GCode Viewer, which does not show jobs that have no extrusions.
This plugin has been tested primarily with Marlin-flavored gcode.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/vector76/cnc_gcodeviewer/archive/main.zip

\(Optional\) You may wish to disable the native Octoprint GCode Viewer, or else the UI will try to 
show both tabs, which may become confusing.
