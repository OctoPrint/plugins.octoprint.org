This plugin is intended to control your printer enclosure using raspberry pi GPIO (At the moment this plugin only support raspberry pi).

A list of things that you can do:
* Add temperature sensors on your enclosure or near your printer
* Add active heaters on your enclosure and keep the temperature nice and high for large ABS
* Use custom Gcode to control rapsberry pi GPIO
* Use custom Gcode to control neopixel
* Use custom Gcode to control enclosure temperature
* PWM controlled outputs
* PWM controlled outputs based on temperature sensor
* Active cooling for good PLA printing
* Schedule GPIO's to turn on and off with a fixed period of time during printing.
* Mechanical buttons to pause and resume printer jobs
* Mechanical buttons to send GCODE to the printer
* Mechanical buttons to control raspberry pi GPIO
* Multiple filament sensors for dual or more extruders
* Alarm when enclosure temperature reaches some sort of value
* Notifications using IFTTT when events happen (temperature trigger / print events / etc)
* Add sub-menus on navbar to quick access outputs and temperature sensors

There is also an API that can be used to interact with the plugin with other software
