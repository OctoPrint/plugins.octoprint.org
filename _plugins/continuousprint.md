# Continuous Print

This is a simple plugin that, as its name suggests, allows _continuous print_. The gcode files are first loaded into a queue. Once this queue is started, the queue will automatically print from top to bottom. Between prints, it will run bed clearing commands so your prints won't get messed up. 
Dependeing on your printer, and the material you are printing with, you may need to change the bed clearing commands.
