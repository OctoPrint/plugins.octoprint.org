[OctoPrint](http://octoprint.org/) plugin that integrates with 1 or 2 filament sensors hooked up to a Raspberry Pi GPIO pin and allows the filament spool to be changed during a print if the filament runs out or is jammed.

You can pause or send GCode commands when a sensor is tripped. Behaviours can be different between the runout sensor and the jam sensor.

An API is available to check the filament sensors status via a GET method:
* to `/plugin/filamentrevolutions/filament` for the filament sensor
* to `/plugin/filamentrevolutions/jammed` for the jam sensor

- `{status: "-1"}` if the sensor is not setup
- `{status: "0"}` if the sensor is OFF (filament not present/filament not jammed)
- `{status: "1"}` if the sensor is ON (filament present/filament jammed)

Here's the settings page:

Initial work based on the [Octoprint-Filament-Reloaded](https://github.com/kontakt/Octoprint-Filament-Reloaded) plugin by kontakt.
