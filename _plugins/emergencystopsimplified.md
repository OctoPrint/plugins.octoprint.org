#### Description

This plugin reacts to a switch or button, if triggered (switch open) it issues **M112** command to printer.

Let's check some features:
* info pop-up when plugin hasn't been configured
* user-friendly and easy to configure
* runs on OctoPrint 1.3.0 and higher

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/Mechazawa/Emergency_stop_simplified

## Configuration

Configuration couldn't be simpler, all you need is to configure listening board pin (board mode) and if the second switch terminal is connected to ground or 3.3V.

Default pin is -1 (not configured) and ground (as it is safer, read below).

**WARNING! Never connect the switch input to 5V as it could fry the GPIO section of your Raspberry!**
