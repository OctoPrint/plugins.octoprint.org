A plugin to intercept the gcode command ```M18``` during the queueing stage and rewrite it as ```M84``` before sending it to the printer (for compatibility with the Repetier line of firmware).

Note: Because this plugin intercepts the code during the queueing stage, that also includes manual gcode entry. Entering ```M18``` in the terminal tab will also result in it being send to the printer as ```M84```, and as this plugin works in OctoPrint's server back end, no visible UI changes or settings are present.
