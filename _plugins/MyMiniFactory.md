# OctoPrint-MyMiniFactory

This plugin adds the ability to register your OctoPrint based printer to the MyMiniFactory&reg; __Click & Print__ service. All slicing is completed on the MyMiniFactory&reg; servers and is optimized for printing PLA to specific supported printers. E-Mail MyMiniFactory&reg; [here](mailto:info@myminifactory.com) if you would like to get your printer added.

## Install

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-MyMiniFactory/archive/master.zip

## Setup

Once installed go into OctoPrint Settings > MyMiniFactory&reg; and select your connected printer's manufacturer and model and click the register button.  A QR code will be generated that can be scanned in the MyMiniFactory&reg; mobile application ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myminifactoryapps&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myminifactory/id1313773617?mt=8)) and associates with your account. Once registration is complete the printer should be listed in the mobile application as either Free, Busy, or Offline based on the current state.

## Printing

From within the mobile application find a verified __Click & Print__ model and click the Print button.  Select your newly added printer from the top of the list under `Your Printers` and press the `Print This Object` button.  The file will be sliced and added to your printer queue; find the newly added file and press the `Print` button. The gcode file will be downloaded to OctoPrint and start printing.
