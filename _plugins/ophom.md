# You only need the following if your plugin requires specific OctoPrint versions or
# specific operating systems to function - you can safely remove the whole
# "compatibility" block if this is not the case.

compatibility:

  # List of compatible versions
  #
  # A single version number will be interpretated as a minimum version requirement,
  # e.g. "1.3.1" will show the plugin as compatible to OctoPrint versions 1.3.1 and up.
  # More sophisticated version requirements can be modelled too by using PEP440
  # compatible version specifiers.
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "octoprint" block. Removing it will default to all
  # OctoPrint versions being supported.

  octoprint:
  - 1.2.0

  # List of compatible operating systems
  #
  # Valid values:
  #
  # - windows
  # - linux
  # - macos
  # - freebsd
  #
  # There are also two OS groups defined that get expanded on usage:
  #
  # - posix: linux, macos and freebsd
  # - nix: linux and freebsd
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "os" block. Removing it will default to all
  # operating systems being supported.

  os:
  - linux
  - windows
  - macos
  - freebsd
  
  # Compatible Python version
  #
  # Plugins should aim for compatibility for Python 2 and 3 for now, in which case the value should be ">=2.7,<4".
  #
  # Plugins that only wish to support Python 3 should set it to ">=3,<4". 
  #
  # If your plugin only supports Python 2 (worst case, not recommended for newly developed plugins since Python 2
  # is EOL), leave at ">=2.7,<3"
  
  python: ">=2.7,<4"

### Automatic Shudown

Switch a Philips Hue that your printer is connected to _ON_ or _OFF_.  
You can set an automatic switch-off based on a minimum temperature.

The Philips Hue bridge have an internal clock. Ophom can create à delayed power off for a conventional shutdown of the system (eg: Raspberry Pi powered by printer PSU)

### Security Shudown

There are different security option for cuting power in case there is a problem:
- If the data connection to the printer is lost
- If an ermegency stop (M112 GCODE) is send to the printer
- If a maximum temperature is reached by the nozzle or the bed

### Hue Sytem Rules

You can create rules on your Bridge for automatic power on/off other Hue devices at the same time your change the state of your plug.
