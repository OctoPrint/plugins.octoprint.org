# Pause Management

Plugin allowing to ignore upcoming pauses in gcode or add additional pauses while printing.

## Operation

![sidebar screenshot](/assets/img/plugins/pause_management/screenshot_sidebar.png)

Use the toggle button in the sidebar to ignore pre-existing configurable pause command, see Settings below.

Use the + button to inject a configurable pause command at provided height or layer number, see Settings section below.


## Settings

![screenshot settings](/assets/img/plugins/pause_management/screenshot_settings.png)

- `Pause Command to Ignore`: Configure this setting to match the pause command used by your slicer. This is what will be ignored when the toggle button in the sidebar is enabled.
- `Pause Command to Inject`: Configure this setting as the pause command that you want to send at given pause positions in the sidebar.
- `Layer Indicator`: Configure this setting to match the custom command added to your slicer to let the plugin know what height or layer number the print is at. This is used to match against the pause positions added in the sidebar. See the Slicer Setup section below for more details.

## Slicer Setup

In order for the injection of pause commands to work a configurable layer indicator needs to be added to your slicer's before layer change gcode script.

For PrusaSlicer that setting can be found in Printer Settings > Custom G-code. You have a couple of options to use based on how you want to enter pause positions in the sidebar.

- **Height**: `@PAUSE_POSITION [layer_z]`
- **Layer Number**: `@PAUSE_POSITION [layer_num]`
