Delete/Move automatically the Print-Model: 
* after successful print. If the print fails, the deletion is not executed!
* after predefined days

#### Support my Efforts

This plugin, as well as my [other plugins](https://github.com/OllisGit/) were developed in my spare time.
If you like it, I would be thankful about a cup of coffee :)

## Details
The user can enable automatic deletion/movement after each print by using a checkbox in the sidebar.

If you want to delete/move files after a couple of days, use the Plugin-Settings. Deletion/Movement is done while opening OctoPrint.

For implementation details, please visit the [homepage]({{ page.homepage | absolute_url }}).
