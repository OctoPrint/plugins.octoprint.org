Delete automatically the Print-Model: 
* after successful print. If the print fails, the deletion is not executed!
* after predefined days

The user can enable automatic deletion after each print by using a checkbox in the sidebar.

If you want to delete files after a couple of days, use the Plugin-Settings. Deletion in done while opening OctoPrint.
