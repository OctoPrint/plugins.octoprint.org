A Octoprint-Plugin that allows to execute a print without heating your bed or nozzle, turning on any fans, or extruding any filament.

#### Support my Efforts

This plugin, as well as my [other plugins](https://github.com/OllisGit/) were developed in my spare time.
If you like it, I would be thankful about a cup of coffee :)

## Details
The implementation is based on the "test-mode" from [Octolapse](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/)
