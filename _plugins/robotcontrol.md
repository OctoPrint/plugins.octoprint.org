# Robot Control Plugin

Plugin for controling my robot via the i2c bus.


## Configuration

Currently For a four servo robot(I plan to add support for more).

You will also need to enable i2c bus via ```sudo raspi-cofig``` through the terminal, accessible through ```ssh pi@octopi.local:22```

then
```interface options>enable i2c>yes>finish```

For the raspi, addresses cannot be lower than 3, and the arduino only use addresses higher than 8, so the address must be an integer 8-127, and must be the same for the adruino and the raspi.

There are sliders in the robot control tab, and gcodes can be used with the format ```@servo[1..4]:[ANGLE]```, such as ```@servo2:90``` or ```@servo4:12```.
