# "compatibility" block if this is not the case.

compatibility:

  # List of compatible versions
  #
  # A single version number will be interpreted as a minimum version requirement,
  # e.g. "1.3.1" will show the plugin as compatible to OctoPrint versions 1.3.1 and up.
  # More sophisticated version requirements can be modelled too by using PEP440
  # compatible version specifiers.
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "octoprint" block. Removing it will default to all
  # OctoPrint versions being supported.

  octoprint:
  - 1.4.0

  # List of compatible operating systems
  #
  # Possible values:
  #
  # - windows
  # - linux
  # - macos
  # - freebsd
  #
  # There are also two OS groups defined that get expanded on usage:
  #
  # - posix: linux, macos and freebsd
  # - nix: linux and freebsd
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "os" block. Removing it will default to all
  # operating systems being supported.

  os:

  # Compatible Python version
  #
  # Plugins should aim for compatibility for Python 2 and 3 for now, in which case the value should be ">=2.7,<4".
  #
  # Plugins that only wish to support Python 3 should set it to ">=3,<4".
  #
  # If your plugin only supports Python 2 (worst case, not recommended for newly developed plugins since Python 2
  # is EOL), leave at ">=2.7,<3"

  python: ">=2.7,<4"

## How To Use Arc Welder
Please read the [readme file](https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderPlugin/#arc-welder-anti-stutter) in the Github Repository for installation and usage instructions.  I am planning to add a complete wiki for the plugin in the near future and will link to that here when it is complete.

Please note that if you are using Python 3, you may need to install the *python3-dev* package before Arc Welder will install. This is detailed in the [prerequisites section of the readme file](https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderPlugin/#prerequisites) linked to above.

## What Arc Welder Does
Arc welder attempts to replace G0/G1 (linear move) GCodes with G2/G3 (arc move) GCodes.  This can substantially compress many GCode files and may reduce stuttering caused by sending many tiny movements in rapid succession over a slower serial connection.  Here is an example of the before and after of a single layer of a cylinder with archimedean infill produced by PrusaSlicer:
<figure style="text-align:center">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/plugins/arc_welder/gcode_cylinder_before_after.png" alt="An ncviewer visualization of GCode produced by PrusaSlicer"/>
    <figcaption>
        <i>Before:  GCode generated by PrusaSlicer.  After: GCode processed by ArcWelder.  Visualized with <a href="https://ncviewer.com/">ncviewer</a>.</i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
Each dot in the image above represents the start or endpoint of an extrusion.  You can easily see that the *After* GCode above has far fewer moves. The processed GCode was 76.1% smaller with 96.4% fewer extrusion/retraction commands than the original file.  Detailed statistics are created and stored for each GCode file processed:
<figure style="text-align:center">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/plugins/arc_welder/gcode_cylinder_test_statistics.jpg" alt="Postprocessing Statistics"/>
    <figcaption>
        <i>Statistics of the arc-welded file, showing a substantial reduction in file size and extrusion/retraction moves.</i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The results above are not typical, since the source file is almost entirely circular.  A better real world example, the first layer of the famous [3DBenchy](http://www.3dbenchy.com/), sliced with PrusaSlicer using archimedean infill is shown below:

<figure style="text-align:center">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/plugins/arc_welder/3dbenchy_before_after.png" alt="A Before and After of 3D Benchy"/>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

The result is a GCode file that is 56.2% smaller (2.3 compression ratio) with 75.0% fewer extrusion/retraction commands.  In this case, Arc Welder shows a massive decrease in small extrusion moves between 0.01mm and 5mm in length:

## How Arc Welder Works
Arc Welder reads each GCode in the source file, searching for three extrusion or retraction commands in a row.  It adds adds these points to a special shape detection class that determines if the collected points can be represented by an arc command (G2/G3).  Once an arc is detected, Arc Welder compares the original GCode path with the resulting arc command to ensure that any deviation is within the specified resolution (by default, +-0.025mm).  Arc Welder will continue to add new points to the arc until it detects either a significant deviation from the original GCode or a change in the printer's state (a new layer, a feedrate or offset change, etc.).  It will then pull off the final point from the arc and output the altered G2/G3 command and continue to process the file.  The resulting GCode will not vary from the source file by more than half of the specified resolution, which is configurable.  Here is a rudimentary illustration:

<figure style="text-align:center">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/plugins/arc_welder/arc_creation_example.png" alt="An illustration of how arcs are created."/>
    <figcaption>
        <i>An illustration of how arcs are generated.</i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

In the example above, Arc Welder has created an arc with five points (the blue line) from the original points (red line).  You can see some deviation from the original lines, but it is within the configured resolution of 0.05mm (or +- 0.025mm).  Adding a sixth point to the arc resulted in a deviation that was too large, so only five points were used.  Arc Welder then started a new arc beginning at point 5.  Note:  The endpoints of every arc will ALWAYS line up with the original GCode.

It is important to note that the example above is zoomed WAY in so that the deviation looks very large.  It is, in fact, extremely small and almost impossible to see with the naked eye.  You can customize the resolution in the plugin settings if 0.05mm (+- 0.025mm) is too large for you.

### Arc-Welder Library and Console Application
The core of the Arc Welder plugin is a set of libraries written in c++ based on code that was originally designed for the Octolapse plugin.  This code allows Arc Welder to parse GCode and to determine the printer's position and extruder state after each command.  Since the code is written entirely in c++, it is orders of magnitude faster than similar code written in Python.  The complete source, as well as a console version, and inverse processor (convert G2/G3 to G0/G1), can be found [here](https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderLib).  There are also [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderLib/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CMake+Build+Matrix%22), though I've not gotten them to work properly in macOS and some flavors of Linux.  There are currently no GitHub hosted runners for any Raspberry Pi.  I am working on these issues.

## Firmware Considerations
Your printer's firmware must be capable of printing G2/G3 commands to use the GCode produced by Arc Welder.  Additionally, arc support must be enabled and properly configured.  Firmware support varies, and many older versions produce arcs less accurately and more slowly than expected.

### Marlin
[Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/) has supported arc commands for a long time.  However, starting with [version 2.0.6](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases/tag/2.0.6) arc support has been greatly enhanced.  I recommend you upgrade to at least this version before using Arc Welder.  Arc support must be enabled in your Configuration_adv.h file.

### Prusa Firmware
[Prusa's fork of Marlin](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware) does support G2/G3 commands, however the default settings can produce sharp corners for very small arcs.  Reducing the *MM_PER_ARC_SEGMENT* setting slightly can correct this, but can also introduce stuttering.  Please note that adjusting this setting requires a manual firmware recompile.

I have been toying with the firmware and have submitted a pull request to enhance the capabilities, but it hasn't made it into the firmware yet and may require further modifications.  I am planning to add some enhancements from Marlin 2.0.6 as well.  You can view the pull request [here](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/2657).

Also, some older versions of Prusa's firmware do not support bed leveling adjustments during arc movements.  Please make sure you are using a recent version of the firmware so that interpolated movements are properly leveled.

### Klipper
[Klipper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/) seems to handle G2/G3 commands with ease, as long as the *GCode_arcs* config section is enabled.  G2/G3 support was added on Sept 13, 2019, so make sure you update Klipper if you are using an older version.

### Other Firmware
Though G2/G3 support is not universal, nor are all implementations equal, it is relatively easy to test.  You can do so in the OctoPrint terminal by sending the the following commands, one at a time:

```
G90
G28 X Y
G0 X0 Y0
G2 X40 I20
```

If your printer supports arc commands, it should move across a small arc from the origin.  Please feel free to let me know if your firmware supports arc movements, and I may add it to the list.

**Warning**:  The above GCode has not been tested on all printers.  Please use it with caution and [report any issues here](https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderPlugin/issues).
