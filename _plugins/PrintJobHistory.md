Print Job History-Plugin collects a lot of attributes from OctoPrint itself, like **Filename, Start/End-Time, Status, Username, Slicer-Settings** and many more. But it also grabs informations from other plugins: **Thumbnail, Layer-Information, Filament usage**...

#### Support my Efforts

This plugin, as well as my [other plugins](https://github.com/OllisGit/) were developed in my spare time.
If you like it, I would be thankful about a cup of coffee :)
