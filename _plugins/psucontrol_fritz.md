This sub-plugin adds support for switching FRITZ!Dect Smart Plugs directly from the Octoprint Web Interface.

To use this plugin, you'll also have to install the PSU Control plugin. Without that plugin, this plugin will not function.

For security reasons, it is recommended to create a dedicated user account on your FRITZ!Box with *only* Smart Home privileges.

The AIN in the settings should be taken from the FRITZ!Box Smart Home settings, it should be five digits followed by seven digits.
Of course, the FRITZ!Dect smart home device should be paired with the FRITZ!Box before configuring this plugin. Please refer to
the instructions provided with the device for further details.
