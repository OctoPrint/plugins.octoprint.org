# Octoprint-OctoTweet 1.0.0

OctoTweet is a plugin allowing Octoprint to send notifications to Twitter.
This is a fork of the amazing plugin [Octorant](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/octorant/) by @bchanudet.

### Message Settings

Here you can customize every message handled by Octoprint.

- **Toggle the message** : by unchecking the checkbox in front of the message title, you can disable the message. It won't be sent to Twitter.
- **Message** : you can change the default content here. See the section [Message format](#message-format) for more information.
- **Include snapshot** : if you have a snapshot URL defined in the Octoprint settings, you can choose to upload a snapshot with the message to Twitter.
- **Notify every `XX`%** : specific to the `printing progress` message, this setting allows you to change the frequency of the notification :
    - `10%` means you'll receive a message at 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% ... 80%, 90% of the printing process.
    - `5%` means you'll receive a message at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% ... 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% of the printing process.
    - etc.

### Scripts Settings

Octotweet allows you to launch scripts everytime a message is sent:

- Before sending: perfect for turning some LED on to ensure the webcam will always have enough light when taking the snapshot.
- After sending: perfect for turning the same LED off :smiley:.

Script configuration was deliberately made a little harder, as running scripts exposes much more on the host computer. You can find more indications on the [wiki](https://github.com/bchanudet/OctoPrint-Octorant/wiki/Launching-scripts).

## Message format

Messages are regular twitter messages, which means you can use:
- `:emoji:` shortcuts to display emojis.
- `@mentions` to notify someone.

Some events also support variables, here is a basic list:

**Printing process : started event**
- `{name}`: name of the file that is being printed
- `{path}`: path of the file in its origin location
- `{origin}`: the origin storage location

**Printing process : failed event**
- `{name}`: name of the file that is being printed
- `{path}`: path of the file in its origin location
- `{origin}`: the origin storage location

**Printing process : done event**
- `{name}`: name of the file that is being printed
- `{path}`: path of the file in its origin location
- `{origin}` : the origin storage location
- `{time}`: time needed for the print (in seconds)
- `{time_formatted}` : same as `{time}`, but in a human-readable format (`HH:MM:SS`)

**Printing process : failed event**
- `{name}`: name of the file that is being printed
- `{path}`: path of the file in its origin location
- `{origin}`: the origin storage location
- `{position}`: position of the hotend

**Printing process : paused event**
- `{name}`: name of the file that is being printed
- `{path}`: path of the file in its origin location
- `{origin}`: the origin storage location
- `{position}`: position of the hotend

**Printing process : resumed event**
- `{name}`: name of the file that is being printed
- `{path}`: path of the file in its origin location
- `{origin}`: the origin storage location
- `{position}`: position of the hotend

**Printing progress event**
- `{progress}` : progress in % of the print
- `{spent}`: time spent since the start of the print (in seconds)
- `{spent_formatted}` : same as `{spent}`, but in a human-readable format (`HH:MM:SS`)
- `{remaining}`: time remaining until the end of the print (in seconds)
- `{remaining_formatted}` : same as `{remaining}`, but in a human-readable format (`HH:MM:SS`)

**Printer state : error**
