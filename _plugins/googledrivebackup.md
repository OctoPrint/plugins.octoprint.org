# Google Drive Backup

This plugin will automatically upload a backup upon completion to your authorized Google Drive. In order for the plugin to work properly you will have to create a Google OAuth App to authorize access. To create your own Google OAuth app please follow the directions outlined in the [Prerequisites](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-GoogleDriveBackup#create-a-google-oauth-app).

## Configuration

Once the [Prerequisite](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-GoogleDriveBackup#create-a-google-oauth-app) are met and you have downloaded your client_secrets.json file follow the steps [here](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-GoogleDriveBackup#configuration) to authorize the plugin to your newly created OAuth app.
