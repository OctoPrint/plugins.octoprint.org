# TODO
# You only need the following if your plugin requires specific OctoPrint versions or
# specific operating systems to function - you can safely remove the whole
# "compatibility" block if this is not the case.

compatibility:

  # List of compatible versions
  #
  # A single version number will be interpretated as a minimum version requirement,
  # e.g. "1.3.1" will show the plugin as compatible to OctoPrint versions 1.3.1 and up.
  # More sophisticated version requirements can be modelled too by using PEP440
  # compatible version specifiers.
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "octoprint" block. Removing it will default to all
  # OctoPrint versions being supported.

  octoprint:
  - 1.3.8

  # List of compatible operating systems
  #
  # Valid values:
  #
  # - windows
  # - linux
  # - macos
  # - freebsd
  #
  # There are also two OS groups defined that get expanded on usage:
  #
  # - posix: linux, macos and freebsd
  # - nix: linux and freebsd
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "os" block. Removing it will default to all
  # operating systems being supported.

  os:
  - linux
  - windows

### Curious if the AI Failure Detection Really Works?

To date, our AI failure detection has watched over **60-million hours** of 3D priting and caught hundreds of thousands of failures. Here are a few real-life examples:

### Getting Started

Setting up Obico is easy! Just install the Obico plugin and follow the steps in the setup wizard! If you run into any trouble getting started, you can check out the [Obico for OctoPrint Setup Guide](https://obico.io/docs/user-guides/octoprint-plugin-setup/).

Create an Obico Cloud account to run Obico with no extra setup required or you can self-host your own Obico Server. [Learn more about the different ways to run Obico](https://obico.io/obico-cloud-vs-self-hosted.html).

<br />

### Is Obico Free?

The Obico Cloud free plan is 100% free! Some features are limited due to the cost required for us to run and maintain the Obico Cloud. The Pro Plan gives you full access to all of Obico‚Äôs features for the price of a couple of coffees per month. [See the pricing](https://app.obico.io/ent_pub/pricing/).

Of course, since Obico is open-source, you are **free** (sorry for the pun!) to self-host your own Obico Server! [Compare self-hosting versus Obico Cloud]( https://obico.io/obico-cloud-vs-self-hosted.html), or [read the self-hosting documentation](https://www.obico.io/docs/server-guides/).
