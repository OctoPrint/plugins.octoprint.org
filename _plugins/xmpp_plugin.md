# A Simple XMPP Plugin for octoprint.

This plugin lets you configure an account to connect to a
[xmpp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) server to
send notifications about your prints progress to another xmpp account.

Currently this plugin can inform you about the start of the octoprint service as well
as the start/stop of your prints. It is also possible to trigger a notification every x%
of print progress.

Recently a feature was added to configure custom g-codes to trigger notifications.
This makes it possible to get notified about pretty much everything that's contained in
your g-code file. I use it to notify me about a required filament change or when the print
was paused.
