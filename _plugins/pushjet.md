----

Notification plugin for [Octoprint](octoprint.org). It can be used to receive push notifications on your phone using [Pushjet](https://pushjet.io/).
This is practically an adaptation of the plugin from [thijsbekke](https://github.com/thijsbekke/OctoPrint-Pushover/) with minor modification and 
the possibility to sent the notification asynchronously.
