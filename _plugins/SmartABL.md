# SmartABL

## How it works?

The plugin reads `G29*` from ***.gcode** and check the bed mesh
in memory.
- If mesh is updated, `M429 S1` is sent in order to load bed mesh from memory.
- If mesh is outdated or doesn't exist, `G29*` and `M500` are sent in order to
generate a new mesh and save it to eeprom, respectively.
> *: By default, the same ABL command read from your file is sent to the printer.

## Configuration

By default, SmartABL **does not change** the behaviour of the
auto bed leveling. User *must* change default values in settings:

### Settings panel

**Leveling command**
- Ignore gcode read from files and send a custom gcode instead.
Default: disabled (G29).

**Force bed leveling**
- After `#` days. Default: disabled (1).
- After `#` prints. Default: disabled (5).
- If current print bed temperature is different from last print.
Default: disabled.
- If current print hotend temperature is different from last print.
Default: disabled.

**Prints counter**
- Take into account failed prints in the counter.
Default: disabled (only successful prints increase the counter).

### Side panel

- **ABL Restricted**: Normal behaviour, the plugin chooses when to trigger ABL
based on your settings.

- **ABL Always**: Ignore settings; the plugin always trigger ABL. Handy when you
need to force-update your mesh.
