Security and privacy policy
---

Security is a key concern for us. You can rest assured that your device's public address will not be exposed when using this plugin. Communication between Karmen and your Octoprint installation is made using a secure WebSocket channel protected by the HTTPS protocol used by banks, online stores and many more organizations.

Karmen also uses key exchange to make sure it's speaking to the expected device on the other end of the line. The key set is established during the initial setup.

By connecting your Octoprint installation to the Karmen Cloud, you confirm that you understand Karmen Cloud will acquire full control over your device. We guarantee that information about you or about your printers will never be sold or shared to any third party.

Karmen shares basic information with the following parties in order to improve our services and website user experience in general:

- Google Analytics - tracks our website visits and provides statistics
- Stripe - payment provider
- Facebook pixel - website visit statistics and information about traffic sources
- Sentry - helps us analyze and track errors

Of course if you'd like to completely delete your account and all data from Karmen Cloud, we'll do so immediately upon your request.

API key security
---

Never share your keys with ANYONE.

Please follow our guidelines and do not use the primary Octoprint key when setting up the Karmen plugin. Instead you should create a special key for that purpose, as recommended in our tutorial. The full procedure, including the recommended way of creating your API key, can be found at <https://docs.karmen.tech/#/karmen-octo-plugin>.
