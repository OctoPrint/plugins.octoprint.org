## How does SimplyPrint change OctoPrint?

To enhance the user experience as much as possible, SimplyPrint takes control of two core OctoPrint features;
- **GCODE scripts**
    - If you use the _"GCODE scripts"_ feature, the _"cancel", "pause"_ and "resume" GCODE scripts will be syncronized to SimplyPrint and stored in our _"GCODE profiles"_ system. So they won't disappear, you'll just have to modify them via the SimplyPrint platform instead.
- **Printer profiles**
    - When you select which printer you have in SimplyPrint, we know what its details are _(print volume, nozzle, etc.)_, and you can modify it as much as you want. We **automatically create a printer profile** with all the details your printer has in SimplyPrint, and set it as your default profile. Your old profile(s) will _not_ be removed :)
- **_That's it!_** You can use OctoPrint just like before. There's even a _"Go to OctoPrint"_ button on your printer, that takes you to OctoPrint when you're on the same network as your Pi. When you're out, SimplyPrint has got your back!
