## Configuration

You must provide an API Token to be able to upload rendered timelapses to Dropbox.
To do this, [create a Dropbox App](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create)
select `Dropbox API` -> `App Folder` -> Provide Folder Name.
Once the app is created, scroll down to the `OAuth 2` section, and click `Generate Token`. Paste the token into the
settings pane.
