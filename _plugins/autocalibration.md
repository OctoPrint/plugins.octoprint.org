This plugin calibrates your printers [backlash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_%28engineering%29) for the X, Y or Z-axis.

## How does it work?

Make sure your printer is running and connected to OctoPrint before you start the calibration process. The axis moves to home to find the endstop and then slowly away from the endstop to find the point where the backlash is compensated by the moving pulley. Do not interrupt the process, otherwise the backlash would remain 0 regardless of the original value and original extruder offsets are not restored!

## Requirements and Pitfalls

* The Firmware must be Repetier based with active EEPROM-option.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

  pip install https://github.com/platsch/OctoPrint-Autocalibration/archive/master.zip


This work is based on the [OctoPrint-EEprom-Repetier](https://github.com/Salandora/OctoPrint-EEPROM-Repetier) plugin by Salandora.
