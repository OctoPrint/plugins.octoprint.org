compatibility:

  # List of compatible versions
  #
  # A single version number will be interpretated as a minimum version requirement,
  # e.g. "1.3.1" will show the plugin as compatible to OctoPrint versions 1.3.1 and up.
  # More sophisticated version requirements can be modelled too by using PEP440
  # compatible version specifiers.
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "octoprint" block. Removing it will default to all
  # OctoPrint versions being supported.

  octoprint:
  - 1.3.9

  python: ">=2.7,<4"

  # List of compatible operating systems
  #
  # Valid values:
  #
  # - windows
  # - linux
  # - macos
  # - freebsd
  #
  # There are also two OS groups defined that get expanded on usage:
  #
  # - posix: linux, macos and freebsd
  # - nix: linux and freebsd
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "os" block. Removing it will default to all
  # operating systems being supported.

This plugin will change the way octoprint send back progress information to the plugins and apps.

Octoprint send progress information based on file progression.

This plugin will send progress information based on the time left to print.

It will apply change for all plugin and apps that display progression information. It keep sending file progress to the estimators.

I suggest to associate those plugins:
 * Print Time Genius (https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/PrintTimeGenius/)
 * DetailedProgress (https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/detailedprogress/).
