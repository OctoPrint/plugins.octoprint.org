# Slicer Estimator - for an accurate remaining time to print and custom metadata in OctoPrint
With this plugin you can use the more accurate estimation of the slicer instead of OctoPrints estimations. So it will be very accurate, as the slicer created each command of the GCODE.
Also it is possible to add custom metadata to the GCODE and make it visible in OctoPrints filelist or printer state view. For example the material the GCODE is created for becomes visible inside OctoPrint. 
And if you like to know when a M600 filament change is expected or a MMU tool switch it is also shown.

The the syntax of the following slicers is known and selected automatically:

* Cura
* Simplify3D
* PrusaSlicer
* SuperSlicer
* Creality Slicer


A more detailed description and manual is available on Github - the plugin's homepage on the right.

For plugin developers an [API description is available](https://github.com/NilsRo/OctoPrint-SlicerEstimator/blob/master/API_DOC.md) to add metadata also in other plugins.


More configurations can be added, please request additions via a [Github issue](https://github.com/NilsRo/OctoPrint-SlicerEstimator/issues).
