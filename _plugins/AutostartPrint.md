The Plugin starts a print job after the Printer is connected (e.g. after powering up). It selects the newest uploaded file for print.

#### Support my Efforts

This plugin, as well as my [other plugins](https://github.com/OllisGit/) were developed in my spare time.
If you like it, I would be thankful about a cup of coffee :)
