A customised user interface for OctoPrint, that has been optimised for iOS devices. 

The plugin requires the Nautilus iOS app which is available on [Apple AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1125992543). 

Starting with version 2 of the iOS application, support for multiple printers can be added via in-app purchase.  Multi-printer configuration is supported only on devices with iCloud enabled.
