#### Description

This plugin reacts to filament sensor output. If triggered it issues M600 X0 Y0 command to printer. 
It is based on Octoprint-Filament-Reloaded by kontakt but the logic behind is different.

This was only tested on my printer running Marlin 2.0.4.4 so sorry if any bugs present.

#### Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/luckyx182/Filament_sensor_simplified/archive/master.zip

#### Configuration

Configuration couldn't be simpler, all you need is to configure listening board pin (board mode) and if the second switch terminal is connected to ground or 3.3V.

Default pin is -1 (not configured) and ground (as it is safer, read below).

**WARNING! Never connect the switch input to 5V as it could fry the GPIO section of your Raspberry!**
