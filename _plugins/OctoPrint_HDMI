This project is a Python plugin for OctoPrint that allows you to stream the OctoPrint page to the HDMI port of a Raspberry Pi. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as:
- Providing a local display for your 3D printer: This can be helpful if you want to monitor your prints without having to connect to OctoPrint over the network.
- Creating a standalone 3D printing station: This can be useful if you want to set up a 3D printing station that is not connected to the internet.
