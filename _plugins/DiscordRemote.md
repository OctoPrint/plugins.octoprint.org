# DiscordRemote

DiscordRemote is a plugin that allows OctoPrint to be interacted with using a Discord bot.

The bot is able to post messages to a discord channel based on events, and can include screenshots.

The bot also listens on the channel, for certain commands, will execute actions on the machine.
A list of supported commands is available by sending a "/help" message.
It is currently capable of:

* Starting a print.
* Aborting a print.
* Listing the files.
* Taking a snapshot with the configured webcam.
* Connecting and Disconnecting to the printer.


**Important**: There are no permissions or controls as to who can send commands to the bot. 
This **MUST** be done by the owner of the Discord channel.
