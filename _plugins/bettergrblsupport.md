# You only need the following if your plugin requires specific OctoPrint versions or
# specific operating systems to function - you can safely remove the whole
# "compatibility" block if this is not the case.

compatibility:

  # List of compatible versions
  #
  # A single version number will be interpreted as a minimum version requirement,
  # e.g. "1.3.1" will show the plugin as compatible to OctoPrint versions 1.3.1 and up.
  # More sophisticated version requirements can be modeled too by using PEP440
  # compatible version specifiers.
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "octoprint" block. Removing it will default to all
  # OctoPrint versions being supported.

  octoprint:
  - 1.3.10

  # List of compatible operating systems
  #
  # Valid values:
  #
  # - windows
  # - linux
  # - macos
  # - freebsd
  #
  # There are also two OS groups defined that get expanded on usage:
  #
  # - posix: linux, macos and freebsd
  # - nix: linux and freebsd
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "os" block. Removing it will default to all
  # operating systems being supported.

# Better Grbl Support Plugin for Octoprint

![grbl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnea/gnea-Media/master/Grbl%20Logo/Grbl%20Logo%20250px.png)

This plugin was inspired by mic159's Grbl Support plugin (https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/octoprint-grbl-plugin/).  His plugin gets you 90% of the way there for adding Grbl support to Octoprint but had a couple limitations and lacked some bells and whistles from a UI and configuration perspective.

**Better Grbl Support** originally utilized mic159's gcode receiver parser but at this point I've moved well beyond his reference implementation.  

Here are some of bgs's capabilities (as of v2.0.0):

* Fully supports Laser and CNC operations / workflows
* Provides for 10 axes of movement / jogging
* Machine and Work Positioning Homing / Origin setup
* Allows for full management of All Grbl settings ($$)
* Provides rich details for all Grbl settings, messages, alarms, and errors
* Supports Z-Probing and customization of Z-Probe settings
* 9 Point Framing and auto generation of Framing dimensions
* Detects and automatically supports Grbl 1.1 Jogging
* Fully integrates with Octoprint Start/Pause/Resume/Cancel operations
* All global configuration changes to Octoprint are reverted on uninstall
* All conversions of typical marlin/repetier/etc commands to Grbl are preset
* Disables Octoprint functions which interfere with Grbl
* Disables the built-in GCode Viewer
* Disables the built-in Temperature tab
* Disables the built-in Control tab (It can be re-enabled via Settings)
* Supports compressed/shorthand Grbl generated by numerous post processors

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/synman/OctoPrint-Bettergrblsupport/archive/master.zip

**NOTE:** Installing this pluging directly from the URL above ensures you always have the latest version, but this comes with risk.  I do not always follow a traditional gitflow which means commits to the master branch may not be fully tested and could cause unforeseen issues. Proceed at your own risk.  

## Configuration

Pay special attention to the following config.yaml configuration parameters.  These settings are modified upon plugin installation.  While the uninstaller removes any customizations, please note the below in the event something unexpected happens:

* appearance / components / temperature tab
* controls (any / all customizations made to it)
* feature / temperatureGraph
* feature / gcodeVisualizer
* feature / modelSizeDetection
* serial / neverSendChecksum
* serial / checksumRequiringCommands
* serial / helloCommand
* plugins / _disabled / printer_safety_check
* appearance / components / disabled / tab 
* gcodeViewer
