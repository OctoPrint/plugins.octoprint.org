# Octoprint-TerminalMessaging

Plugin that adds styling to the terminal tab that makes it easier to see where a message is from.

Messages you send are on the right and are in green. Messages the printer sends back are on the left
and in blue.

This is similar to how a text messaging app would differentiate between sender and receiver in the
UI.

This plugin is very small, and just edits the css of the elements in the terminal for readability.

Enjoy!
