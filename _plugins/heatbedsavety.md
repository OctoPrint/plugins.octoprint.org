This plugin is able to control a relais in serial connection to a solid state relais of a high power heatbes solution.
Solid state relais some times getting shorted when they are damaged and will heat up to ~200Â°C out of conrtol of the printer.
This plugin cut the solid state from power when a configured temperature is reached or an error is thrown by the printer.

In some countries, not everybody is allowed to create or change 230V/130V electrical cicuits.
In this case you'll do the changes !! AT YOUR OWN RISK !! and no insurence will pay a damage.
