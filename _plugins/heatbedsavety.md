This plugin is able to control a relay in serial connection to a solid state relay of a high power heatbed solution.
Solid state relay sometimes get shorted when they are damaged and will heat the bed up to ~200Â°C with no control from the printer.
This plugin cuts the solid state relay from power when a configured temperature is reached or an error is thrown by the printer.

In some countries, not everybody is allowed to connect or modify 230V/130V electrical cicuits.
In this case you'll do the changes !! AT YOUR OWN RISK !! and no insurance will cover damage.
