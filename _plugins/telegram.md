This plugin integrates Telegram Messenger into Octoprint.

You can receive automatic notifications with webcam images before and after a print -
and even during a print at customizable heights or after a certain time (e.g. after every
5mm of height OR after 10 minutes - whatever happend first).

You can also control Octoprint via messages. Send /status to receive the current status,
/abort to abort the currently running print or /help to receive a list of available commands.

Please have a look at [the documentation at github](https://github.com/fabianonline/OctoPrint-Telegram/blob/stable/README.md) 
to learn how to register a Telegram bot. This is a needed step in order to make this plugin work.
