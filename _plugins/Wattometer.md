# Plugin Setup
Once the plugin is installed, you will have to enter your FRITZ username and password in the settings tab.
If you don't have an account yet, the following [guide](https://en.avm.de/service/knowledge-base/dok/FRITZ-Box-7590/966_Creating-a-MyFRITZ-account-and-setting-it-up-in-the-FRITZ-Box/) will help you to create one. 
For security reasons, it is recommended to create a dedicated user account on your FRITZ!Box with *only* Smart Home privileges.

Furthermore you will have to enter the AIN of your FRITZ smart plug. This [tutorial](https://en.avm.de/service/knowledge-base/dok/FRITZ-DECT-200/3269_Setting-up-the-switch-on-sound-function-for-FRITZ-DECT-smart-plug/) will help you to find the AIN of your device.

# Plugin Description
