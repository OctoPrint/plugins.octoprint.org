A OctoPrint-Plugin that sends the current progress of a print via M117 command to the printer-display and also to the top navigation bar.
A new feature is the "Desktop Printer-Display", which shows all M117 messages in a Desktop PopUp.

It shows the **percentage, the current layer, total layer count, current height and total height**:

- Printer Display: 50% L=60/120 H=23mm/47mm  
- NavBar: Layer: 60 / 120 Height: 23mm of 47mm

*Output pattern is adjustable!*

**ATTENTION:** 
- The layer information works only when the slicer adds "layer-indicator" to the g-code (CURA-Example as comments like ```;LAYER:10```). Then these indicators are parsed via a regular-expression.
- Currently supported slicers: CURA, Simplify3D, KISSlicer. You can add your own layer-expressions in Plugin-Settings.
If you want to use "slic3r", see [Enhancement #8](https://github.com/OllisGit/OctoPrint-DisplayLayerProgress/issues/8)
- Sometimes there is a "Post Processing script" that deletes all comments (e.g. see [Issue #33](https://github.com/OllisGit/OctoPrint-DisplayLayerProgress/issues/33))
- You need to upload your G-Code after installation of the plugin again (if you want to reuse already stored models in OctoPrint), because while uploading the G-Code is modfied
- The total height "calculation" can be done in two ways: 1)the max Z-Value in the G-Code, 2) max Z-Value with extrusion in this height
- The height/layer information is sometimes not matching with G-Code Viewer, because the viewer did a lot of "magic" (e.g. add extrusion diameter to height)
