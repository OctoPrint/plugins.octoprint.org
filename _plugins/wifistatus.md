This plugin will add a WiFi status indicator to the OctoPrint navigation bar to give an at-a-glance indication of the quality of the WiFi connection. Hovering over (or clicking on mobile) the indicator will provide more details on the connection.

This plugin will only work on Linux and if OctoPrint is running under Python 3.7 or higher. See <https://github.com/cp2004/Octoprint-Upgrade-To-Py3> if you wish to upgrade your OctoPrint installation to use Python 3.
