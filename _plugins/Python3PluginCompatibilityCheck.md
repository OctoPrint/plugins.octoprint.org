# Python 3 Check

This plugin simply adds a section in settings that allows you to check your installed plugins against the OctoPrint Plugin Repository list to see which ones are not yet Python 3 compatible.

## Checking Compatibility

After installing, open OctoPrint's settings and click `Python 3 Check` in the plugins section. Press the `Check Compatibility` button and a list of links to the plugin's homepages will be generated. Click the link and open a new issue in the plugin's repository requesting for Python 3 compatibility.
