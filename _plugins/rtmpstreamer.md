# RTMP Streamer

Plugin that adds a tab to OctoPrint for viewing, starting, and stopping a re-encoded stream to any RTMP server. Only tested with Twitch.

**Notes:** 
- Plugin requires that OctoPrint's webcam stream uses a full url path including the ip address, ie `http://192.168.1.2/webcam/?action=stream`
- Only tested streaming to Twitch from a Pi3.
- Plugin does not provide a streaming application, it just re-encodes the mjpg stream (included with ocotpi) to a flv stream and transmits to configured RTMP server url.
- Although resolution is configurable in the plugin, the mjpg input stream being re-encoded may have a lower resolution and therefore not really be as high as you set it in the plugin settings.

## Prerequisites

In order to stream please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-RTMPStreamer/blob/master/docker_instructions.md).  If you are just wanting to watch a stream enter the view url in settings, no other prerequisites are required.

## Settings
