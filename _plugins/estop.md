Adds a nice big emergency stop button that (by default) sends M112 to the printer in the case of an emergency. If your printer uses a different E-Stop command, there's a settings page entry to allow changing the command sent.

Please do be aware that this button is no substitute for human interaction in the case of a real emergency. How your printer responds to M112 depends entirely on its firmware.
