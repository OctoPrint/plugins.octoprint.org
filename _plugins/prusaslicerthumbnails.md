# Slicer Thumbnails

This plugin will extract embedded thumbnails from gcode files created from [PrusaSlicer](#PrusaSlicer), [SuperSlicer](#SuperSlicer), [Cura](#Cura), or [Simplify3D](#Simplify3D).

The preview thumbnail can be shown in OctoPrint from the files list by clicking the newly added image button.

The thumbnail will open in a modal window.

If enabled in settings the thumbnail can also be embedded as an inline thumbnail within the file list itself. If you use this option it's highly recommended to also set the option to set file list height or position inline image to the left.

**Warning**: the higher the resolution of the thumbnail you use in this setting the larger your gcode file will be when sliced.

### SuperSlicer

**Warning**: the higher the resolution of the thumbnail you use in this setting the larger your gcode file will be when sliced.

### Cura
