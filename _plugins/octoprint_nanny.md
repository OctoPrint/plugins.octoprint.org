# You only need the following if your plugin requires specific OctoPrint versions or
# specific operating systems to function - you can safely remove the whole
# "compatibility" block if this is not the case.

compatibility:

  # List of compatible versions
  #
  # A single version number will be interpretated as a minimum version requirement,
  # e.g. "1.3.1" will show the plugin as compatible to OctoPrint versions 1.3.1 and up.
  # More sophisticated version requirements can be modelled too by using PEP440
  # compatible version specifiers.
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "octoprint" block. Removing it will default to all
  # OctoPrint versions being supported.

  octoprint:
  - 1.5.0

  # List of compatible operating systems
  #
  # Valid values:
  #
  # - windows
  # - linux
  # - macos
  # - freebsd
  #
  # There are also two OS groups defined that get expanded on usage:
  #
  # - posix: linux, macos and freebsd
  # - nix: linux and freebsd
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "os" block. Removing it will default to all
  # operating systems being supported.

  os:
  - linux
  
  # Compatible Python version
  #
  # Plugins should aim for compatibility for Python 2 and 3 for now, in which case the value should be ">=2.7,<4".
  #
  # Plugins that only wish to support Python 3 should set it to ">=3,<4". 
  #
  # If your plugin only supports Python 2 (worst case, not recommended for newly developed plugins since Python 2
  # is EOL), leave at ">=2.7,<3"
  
  python: ">=3,<4"

### Will this plugin cost money?

Short answer: _yes_

Longer answer: Print Nanny will be released under an Open Source license in 2021, financially supported by a cloud-hosted subscription service and business licensing model. That means the OctoPrint plugin, webapp, data & training pipelines, and machine learning model architechtures & trained weights will be 100% Open Source. ðŸ¦¾ My mission is to provide:

* Free ("free" as in "freedom", not "free" as in "free beer") self-hosted, self-supported community distribution.
* Low-cost hosted tier for hobbyists with one or two printers.
* Premium support for print shops and e-commerce stores.

Details about pricing will be announced before launch. 

Participation in the Beta test will be rewarded with special discounts and swag giveaways.
