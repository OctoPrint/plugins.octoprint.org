When `echo:busy: paused for user` is received on the serial port, this plugin then raises a `paused_for_user` event, which may then be used with other plugins like [OctoPrint-MQTT](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-MQTT) to alert the user, that the printer needs attention.
The primary use for this is the Prusa MMU2S, which when it fails to load/unload filament, will halt the printer and send this message on serial.

See the plugin's [README](https://github.com/zeroflow/OctoPrint-PauseForUserEvent) for details.
