OctoRemote enables you to perform all usual printer movements with a simple keypress. Current version implements moving the X-, Y- and Z-Axis, homing and controlling up to four extruders.
Movement distance of the extruders can also be controlled via the keypad. An embedded version of the remote controller is in the making and will be released soon.
